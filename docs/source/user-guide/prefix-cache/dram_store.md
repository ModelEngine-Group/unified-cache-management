# DRAM Store

This document provides a usage example and configuration guide for the **DRAM Connector**. This connector enables offloading of KV cache from GPU HBM to CPU DRAM, helping reduce memory pressure and supporting larger models or batch sizes.

## Performance

### Overview
The following are the multi-concurrency performance test results of UCM in the Prefix Cache scenario under a CUDA environment, showing the performance improvements of UCM on two different models.
During the tests, HBM cache was disabled, and KV Cache was retrieved and matched only from DRAM.

In the QwQ-32B model, the test used one H20 server with 2 GPUs.

Here, Full Compute refers to pure VLLM inference, while DRAM80% indicates that after UCM pooling, the DRAM hit rate of the KV cache is 80%.

The following table shows the results on the QwQ-32B model:
|      **QwQ-32B** |                |                     |                |              |
| ---------------: | -------------: | ------------------: | -------------: | :----------- |

## Features

The DRAM connector supports the following functionalities:

- `dump`: Offload KV cache blocks from HBM to DRAM.
- `load`: Load KV cache blocks from DRAM back to HBM.
- `lookup`: Look up KV blocks stored in DRAM by block hash.
- `wait`: Ensure that all copy streams between CPU and GPU have completed.
- `commit`: Mark cache operations as complete and ready for reuse.

## Configuration

To use the DRAM connector, you need to configure the `connector_config` dictionary in your model's launch configuration.

### Required Parameters

- `max_cache_size` *(optional)*:
  Specifies the maximum allowed DRAM memory usage (in **bytes**) for caching in `kv_connector_extra_config["ucm_connector_config"]`.
  If not provided, it defaults to **5 GB**.
- `kv_block_size` *(optional)*:
  Specifies the memory size (in **bytes**) of a single key or value cache block used in vLLM’s paged attention mechanism, which is calculated as : `block_size * head_size * total_num_kv_heads * element_size`.

### Example:

```python
# Allocate up to 8GB DRAM for KV cache
# KV Block size (in byte) is 262144
kv_connector_extra_config={"ucm_connector_name": "UcmDramStore", "ucm_connector_config":{"max_cache_size": 5368709120, "kv_block_size": 262144}}
```

## Launching Inference

### Offline Inference

To start **offline inference** with the DRAM connector，modify the script `examples/offline_inference.py` to include the `kv_connector_extra_config` for DRAM connector usage:

```python
# In examples/offline_inference.py
ktc = KVTransferConfig(
    ...
    kv_connector_extra_config={"ucm_connector_name": "UcmDramStore", "ucm_connector_config":{"max_cache_size": 5368709120, "kv_block_size": 262144}}
)
```

Then run the script as follows:

```bash
cd examples/
python offline_inference.py
```

### Online Inference

For **online inference** , vLLM with our connector can also be deployed as a server that implements the OpenAI API protocol.

First, specify the python hash seed by:
```bash
export PYTHONHASHSEED=123456
```

Run the following command to start the vLLM server with the Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model:

```bash
vllm serve /home/models/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct \
--max-model-len 20000 \
--tensor-parallel-size 2 \
--gpu_memory_utilization 0.87 \
--trust-remote-code \
--port 7800 \
--kv-transfer-config \
'{
    "kv_connector": "UnifiedCacheConnectorV1",
    "kv_connector_module_path": "ucm.integration.vllm.uc_connector",
    "kv_role": "kv_both",
    "kv_connector_extra_config": {
        "ucm_connector_name": "UcmDramStore",
        "ucm_connector_config": {
            "max_cache_size": 5368709120,
            "kv_block_size": 262144
        }
    }
}'
```

If you see log as below:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [32890]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

Congratulations, you have successfully started the vLLM server with DRAM Connector!

After successfully started the vLLM server，You can interact with the API as following:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7800/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "/home/models/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct",
        "prompt": "Shanghai is a",
        "max_tokens": 7,
        "temperature": 0
    }'
```
