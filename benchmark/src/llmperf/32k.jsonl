Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard.\n\nMDCCLXXXVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\n\nIn delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to\ndevelop a character different from those generally portrayed. This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so\nrelaxed her nerves, that she became a mere nothing.\n\nMany such noughts are there in the female world! yet she had a good\nopinion of her own merit,--truly, she said long prayers,--and sometimes\nread her Week's Preparation: she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly\ncalled _hell_, the regions below; but whether her's was a mounting\nspirit, I cannot pretend to determine; or what sort of a planet would\nhave been proper for her, when she left her _material_ part in this\nworld, let metaphysicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed\nspirit.\n\nAs she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French\nwaiting-maid, she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications,\nand while she was dressing her hair, and she could turn her eyes from\nthe glass, she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily\ndissipation, novels. I say bodily, or the animal soul, for a rational\none can find no employment in polite circles. The glare of lights, the\nstudied inelegancies of dress, and the compliments offered up at the\nshrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the senses.\n\nWhen she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way, she\ntried another. The Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other\ninteresting tales were perused with eagerness. Nothing could be more\nnatural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than\nthe views of the human heart. What delicate struggles! and uncommonly\npretty turns of thought! The picture that was found on a bramble-bush,\nthe new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught the swain by the\nupper-garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.--Fatal\nimage!--It planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and sent a\nnew kind of a knight-errant into the world. But even this was nothing to\nthe catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung, the hornet\nsettling on the sleeping lover's face. What a _heart-rending_ accident!\nShe planted, in imitation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but\nthere was not a lover to weep in concert with her, when she watered it\nwith her tears.--Alas! Alas!\n\nIf my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit\nfor genius, I would go on and tell them such tales as would force the\nsweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful\ncheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so\ninteresting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to\nsettle the curls himself, and not interrupt her.\n\nShe had besides another resource, two most beautiful dogs, who shared\nher bed, and reclined on cushions near her all the day. These she\nwatched with the most assiduous care, and bestowed on them the warmest\ncaresses. This fondness for animals was not that kind of\n_attendrissement_ which makes a person take pleasure in providing for\nthe subsistence and comfort of a living creature; but it proceeded from\nvanity, it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest French\nexpressions of ecstatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned\nby tenderness.\n\nShe was chaste, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word, that\nis, she did not make any actual _faux pas_; she feared the world, and\nwas indolent; but then, to make amends for this seeming self-denial, she\nread all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had she\nthought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she\naccompanied the lovers to the lonely arbors, and would walk with them by\nthe clear light of the moon. She wondered her husband did not stay at\nhome. She was jealous--why did he not love her, sit by her side, squeeze\nher hand, and look unutterable things? Gentle reader, I will tell thee;\nthey neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend\nto say that they always annexed an idea to a word; but they had none of\nthose feelings which are not easily analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n\nIn due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following\nyear a daughter. After the mother's throes she felt very few sentiments\nof maternal tenderness: the children were given to nurses, and she\nplayed with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance of her\nrecovering strength; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a\nconsumption, to which her constitution tended. Her children all died in\ntheir infancy, except the two first, and she began to grow fond of the\nson, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her time\nbetween the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death, though\non the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station\noccur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and\nwhen Mary, the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send the\nawkward thing away. To own the truth, she was awkward enough, in a house\nwithout any play-mates; for her brother had been sent to school, and she\nscarcely knew how to employ herself; she would ramble about the garden,\nadmire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told her\nstories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother\ntalked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit; and,\nin the interim desired her own maid to teach her French. As she had\nlearned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her\nway. Neglected in every respect, and left to the operations of her own\nmind, she considered every thing that came under her inspection, and\nlearned to think. She had heard of a separate state, and that angels\nsometimes visited this earth. She would sit in a thick wood in the park,\nand talk to them; make little songs addressed to them, and sing them to\ntunes of her own composing; and her native wood notes wild were sweet\nand touching.\n\nHer father always exclaimed against female acquirements, and was glad\nthat his wife's indolence and ill health made her not trouble herself\nabout them. She had besides another reason, she did not wish to have a\nfine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter; she still\nexpected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was\nvery tyrannical and passionate; indeed so very easily irritated when\ninebriated, that Mary was continually in dread lest he should frighten\nher mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary's tenderness,\nand exercised her compassion so continually, that it became more than a\nmatch for self-love, and was the governing propensity of her heart\nthrough life. She was violent in her temper; but she saw her father's\nfaults, and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her\nown.--She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon, when she\nwas conscious of having erred; and her contrition was so exceedingly\npainful, that she watched diligently the first movements of anger and\nimpatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.\n\nSublime ideas filled her young mind--always connected with devotional\nsentiments; extemporary effusions of gratitude, and rhapsodies of\npraise would burst often from her, when she listened to the birds, or\npursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the\ngloomy path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen\nto the sea that was not far distant. The wandering spirits, which she\nimagined inhabited every part of nature, were her constant friends and\nconfidants. She began to consider the Great First Cause, formed just\nnotions of his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on his wisdom and\ngoodness. Could she have loved her father or mother, had they returned\nher affection, she would not so soon, perhaps, have sought out a new\nworld.\n\nHer sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love; on earth\nit was not to be found: her mother had often disappointed her, and the\napparent partiality she shewed to her brother gave her exquisite\npain--produced a kind of habitual melancholy, led her into a fondness\nfor reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious\ndistress.\n\nShe had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her\nfeet; and her father had a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded\nanimals had souls, or they would not have been subjected to the caprice\nof man; but what was the soul of man or beast? In this style year after\nyear rolled on, her mother still vegetating.\n\nA little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. Mary paid her great\nattention; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her\nmother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child\nwhile she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit of delirium\nstabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal\naccount; and so strongly did it impress her imagination, that every\nnight of her life the bleeding corpse presented itself to her when the\nfirst began to slumber. Tortured by it, she at last made a vow, that if\nshe was ever mistress of a family she would herself watch over every\npart of it. The impression that this accident made was indelible.\n\nAs her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did\nnot understand such a lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only\ngrown still more whimsical, and that if she could be prevailed on to\nexert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In general he\ntreated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered\nwith his pleasures, he expostulated in the most cruel manner, and\nvisibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then assiduously try to turn\nhis attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would\nwatch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she\ncould not rest. Other causes also contributed to disturb her repose: her\nmother's luke-warm manner of performing her religious duties, filled her\nwith anguish; and when she observed her father's vices, the unbidden\ntears would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the\ngate without being relieved; if she could do it unperceived, she would\ngive them her own breakfast, and feel gratified, when, in consequence of\nit, she was pinched by hunger.\n\nShe had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother; they were\nlaughed at, and she determined never to do it again. In this manner was\nshe left to reflect on her own feelings; and so strengthened were they\nby being meditated on, that her character early became singular and\npermanent. Her understanding was strong and clear, when not clouded by\nher feelings; but she was too much the creature of impulse, and the\nslave of compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n\nNear her father's house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in\naffluence, but reduced to great distress by the extravagance of her\nhusband; he had destroyed his constitution while he spent his fortune;\nand dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very\nscanty pittance. The eldest daughter was for some years educated by a\ndistant relation, a Clergyman. While she was with him a young gentleman,\nson to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took particular notice of\nher. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung\nin concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to\nher, cultivated her taste, and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at\nthis juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made every prospect bright,\nand gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She\nreturned to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took\nno more sweet counsel together. This disappointment spread a sadness\nover her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of\nsolitude, and her character appeared similar to Mary's, though her\nnatural disposition was very different.\n\nShe was several years older than Mary, yet her refinement, her taste,\ncaught her eye, and she eagerly sought her friendship: before her return\nshe had assisted the family, which was almost reduced to the last ebb;\nand now she had another motive to actuate her.\n\nAs she had often occasion to send messages to Ann, her new friend,\nmistakes were frequently made; Ann proposed that in future they should\nbe written ones, to obviate this difficulty, and render their\nintercourse more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling;\nMary had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's\nletters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little\npractice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave\nforce to it. In conversation, and in writing, when she felt, she was\npathetic, tender and persuasive; and she expressed contempt with such\nenergy, that few could stand the flash of her eyes.\n\nAs she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.\n\nMary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility.\n\nShe would then imagine that she looked sickly or unhappy, and then all\nher tenderness would return like a torrent, and bear away all\nreflection. In this manner was her sensibility called forth, and\nexercised, by her mother's illness, her friend's misfortunes, and her\nown unsettled mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n\nNear to her father's house was a range of mountains; some of them were,\nliterally speaking, cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested,\nand gave grandeur to the prospect; and down many of their sides the\nlittle bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river.\nThrough the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them\nthe birds sung, particularly the robins; they also found shelter in the\nivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story went; it was situated\non the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the sea.\nThis castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and many tales\nhad the old house-keeper told her of the worthies who had resided there.\n\nWhen her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, she would steal to\nthis retirement, where human foot seldom trod--gaze on the sea, observe\nthe grey clouds, or listen to the wind which struggled to free itself\nfrom the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, she\nadmired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beautiful tints\nthe gleams of sunshine gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in\nexistence, and darted into futurity.\n\nOne way home was through the cavity of a rock covered with a thin layer\nof earth, just sufficient to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs\nand wild plants, which grew on its sides, and nodded over the summit. A\nclear stream broke out of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks\nfallen into it. Here twilight always reigned--it seemed the Temple of\nSolitude; yet, paradoxical as the assertion may appear, when the foot\nsounded on the rock, it terrified the intruder, and inspired a strange\nfeeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat she\nread Thomson's Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.\n\nAt a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who\nsupported their numerous children by their precarious labour. In these\nlittle huts she frequently rested, and denied herself every childish\ngratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants.\nHer heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had\nrelieved their wants, or afforded them pleasure.\n\nIn these pursuits she learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet\ntears of benevolence frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a\nsparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not; on the contrary, they\nwere rather fixed, and would never have been observed if her soul had\nnot animated them. They were not at all like those brilliant ones which\nlook like polished diamonds, and dart from every superfice, giving more\nlight to the beholders than they receive themselves.\n\nHer benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried\nher out of herself; and she rested not till she had relieved or\ncomforted them. The warmth of her compassion often made her so diligent,\nthat many things occurred to her, which might have escaped a less\ninterested observer.\n\nIn like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read,\nand the emotions thereby raised were so strong, that it soon became a\npart of her mind.\n\nEnthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her\nCreator was almost apparent to her senses in his works; but they were\nmostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which she delighted to\ncontemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of\nthe voice that could still the tumultuous deep.\n\nThese propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions\nbegan to exercise their tyrannic sway, and particularly pointed out\nthose which the soil would have a tendency to nurse.\n\nYears after, when wandering through the same scenes, her imagination has\nstrayed back, to trace the first placid sentiments they inspired, and\nshe would earnestly desire to regain the same peaceful tranquillity.\n\nMany nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, _conversing_\nwith the Author of Nature, making verses, and singing hymns of her own\ncomposing. She considered also, and tried to discern what end her\nvarious faculties were destined to pursue; and had a glimpse of a truth,\nwhich afterwards more fully unfolded itself.\n\nShe thought that only an infinite being could fill the human soul, and\nthat when other objects were followed as a means of happiness, the\ndelusion led to misery, the consequence of disappointment. Under the\ninfluence of ardent affections, how often has she forgot this\nconviction, and as often returned to it again, when it struck her with\nredoubled force. Often did she taste unmixed delight; her joys, her\necstacies arose from genius.\n\nShe was now fifteen, and she wished to receive the holy sacrament; and\nperusing the scriptures, and discussing some points of doctrine which\npuzzled her, she would sit up half the night, her favourite time for\nemploying her mind; she too plainly perceived that she saw through a\nglass darkly; and that the bounds set to stop our intellectual\nresearches, is one of the trials of a probationary state.\n\nBut her affections were roused by the display of divine mercy; and she\neagerly desired to commemorate the dying love of her great benefactor.\nThe night before the important day, when she was to take on herself her\nbaptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the sun broke in on her\nmeditations, and found her not exhausted by her watching.\n\nThe orient pearls were strewed around--she hailed the morn, and sung\nwith wild delight, Glory to God on high, good will towards men. She was\nindeed so much affected when she joined in the prayer for her eternal\npreservation, that she could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and\nthe recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly\npassions made it grow languid.\n\nThese various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the\nluxuriant shoots restrained by culture. The servants and the poor adored\nher.\n\nIn order to be enabled to gratify herself in the highest degree, she\npracticed the most rigid oeconomy, and had such power over her\nappetites and whims, that without any great effort she conquered them\nso entirely, that when her understanding or affections had an object,\nshe almost forgot she had a body which required nourishment.\n\nThis habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the\npassions.\n\nWe will now enter on the more active field of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n\nA few months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was\nattacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the\nschool.\n\nShe was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of\nconsequence, and did not call her _the child_. Proper masters were sent\nfor; she was taught to dance, and an extraordinary master procured to\nperfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.\n\nA part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir\nof the person who still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years\nyounger than our heroine. The fathers, spite of the dispute, frequently\nmet, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over a bottle,\ndetermined to quash it by a marriage, and, by uniting the two estates,\nto preclude all farther enquiries into the merits of their different\nclaims.\n\nWhile this important matter was settling, Mary was otherwise employed.\nAnn's mother's resources were failing; and the ghastly phantom, poverty,\nmade hasty strides to catch them in his clutches. Ann had not fortitude\nenough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was\nlodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every\nlittle comfort; things that would be no sacrifice when a person is well,\nare absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily pain, and support the\nanimal functions.\n\nThere were many elegant amusements, that she had acquired a relish for,\nwhich might have taken her mind off from its most destructive bent; but\nthese her indigence would not allow her to enjoy: forced then, by way of\nrelaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the pencil\nhe taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagination,\nand that taste invigorated love.\n\nPoverty, and all its inelegant attendants, were in her mother's abode;\nand she, though a good sort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by\nher trivial, uninteresting chat, the delirium in which her daughter was\nlost.\n\nThis ill-fated love had given a bewitching softness to her manners, a\ndelicacy so truly feminine, that a man of any feeling could not behold\nher without wishing to chase her sorrows away. She was timid and\nirresolute, and rather fond of dissipation; grief only had power to make\nher reflect.\n\nIn every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty,\nthat caught her attention. And in composition, the polish of style, and\nharmony of numbers, interested her much more than the flights of genius,\nor abstracted speculations.\n\nShe often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively\nimagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed\nto the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts,\nand argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most\nviolent passions.\n\nAnn's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her;\nshe wished so continually to have a home to receive her in, that it\ndrove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender\nschemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most\nardently to put them in practice.\n\nFondly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whose\ndecline was so imperceptible, that they were not aware of her\napproaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing the most\nalarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger; and\nthen first mentioned to her his designs with respect to his daughter.\n\nShe approved of them; Mary was sent for; she was not at home; she had\nrambled to visit Ann, and found her in an hysteric fit. The landlord of\nher little farm had sent his agent for the rent, which had long been due\nto him; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remained, and\nturn them out, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.\n\nAs this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the\nperson to whom he was deputy, little was to be expected from his\nforbearance.\n\nAll this was told to Mary--and the mother added, she had many other\ncreditors who would, in all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from\nthem all that had been saved out of the wreck. \"I could bear all,\" she\ncried; \"but what will become of my children? Of this child,\" pointing to\nthe fainting Ann, \"whose constitution is already undermined by care and\ngrief--where will she go?\"--Mary's heart ceased to beat while she asked\nthe question--She attempted to speak; but the inarticulate sounds died\naway. Before she had recovered herself, her father called himself to\nenquire for her; and desired her instantly to accompany him home.\n\nEngrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked\nsilently by his side, when he roused her out of her reverie by telling\nher that in all likelihood her mother had not many hours to live; and\nbefore she could return him any answer, informed her that they had both\ndetermined to marry her to Charles, his friend's son; he added, the\nceremony was to be performed directly, that her mother might be witness\nof it; for such a desire she had expressed with childish eagerness.\n\nOverwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with\na vacant stare, fixed them on her father's face; but they were no longer\na sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain. As she drew near the\nhouse, her wonted presence of mind returned: after this suspension of\nthought, a thousand darted into her mind,--her dying mother,--her\nfriend's miserable situation,--and an extreme horror at taking--at being\nforced to take, such a hasty step; but she did not feel the disgust, the\nreluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.\n\nShe loved Ann better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the\nvery jaws of destruction--she would have encountered a lion. To have\nthis friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to\nher family, would it not be superlative bliss?\n\nFull of these thoughts she entered her mother's chamber, but they then\nfled at the sight of a dying parent. She went to her, took her hand; it\nfeebly pressed her's. \"My child,\" said the languid mother: the words\nreached her heart; she had seldom heard them pronounced with accents\ndenoting affection; \"My child, I have not always treated you with\nkindness--God forgive me! do you?\"--Mary's tears strayed in a\ndisregarded stream; on her bosom the big drops fell, but did not relieve\nthe fluttering tenant. \"I forgive you!\" said she, in a tone of\nastonishment.\n\nThe clergyman came in to read the service for the sick, and afterwards\nthe marriage ceremony was performed. Mary stood like a statue of\nDespair, and pronounced the awful vow without thinking of it; and then\nran to support her mother, who expired the same night in her arms.\n\nHer husband set off for the continent the same day, with a tutor, to\nfinish his studies at one of the foreign universities.\n\nAnn was sent for to console her, not on account of the departure of her\nnew relation, a boy she seldom took any notice of, but to reconcile her\nto her fate; besides, it was necessary she should have a female\ncompanion, and there was not any maiden aunt in the family, or cousin of\nthe same class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n\nMary was allowed to pay the rent which gave her so much uneasiness, and\nshe exerted every nerve to prevail on her father effectually to succour\nthe family; but the utmost she could obtain was a small sum very\ninadequate to the purpose, to enable the poor woman to carry into\nexecution a little scheme of industry near the metropolis.\n\nHer intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight\nwith him, than Mary's arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and\nfriendship; this was a language he did not understand; expressive of\noccult qualities he never thought of, as they could not be seen or\nfelt.\n\nAfter the departure of her mother, Ann still continued to languish,\nthough she had a nurse who was entirely engrossed by the desire of\namusing her. Had her health been re-established, the time would have\npassed in a tranquil, improving manner.\n\nDuring the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing,\nand reading, filled up the time; and Mary's taste and judgment were both\nimproved by contracting a habit of observation, and permitting the\nsimple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.\n\nShe had a wonderful quickness in discerning distinctions and combining\nideas, that at the first glance did not appear to be similar. But these\nvarious pursuits did not banish all her cares, or carry off all her\nconstitutional black bile. Before she enjoyed Ann's society, she\nimagined it would have made her completely happy: she was disappointed,\nand yet knew not what to complain of.\n\nAs her friend could not accompany her in her walks, and wished to be\nalone, for a very obvious reason, she would return to her old haunts,\nretrace her anticipated pleasures--and wonder how they changed their\ncolour in possession, and proved so futile.\n\nShe had not yet found the companion she looked for. Ann and she were not\ncongenial minds, nor did she contribute to her comfort in the degree she\nexpected. She shielded her from poverty; but this was only a negative\nblessing; when under the pressure it was very grievous, and still more\nso were the apprehensions; but when exempt from them, she was not\ncontented.\n\nSuch is human nature, its laws were not to be inverted to gratify our\nheroine, and stop the progress of her understanding, happiness only\nflourished in paradise--we cannot taste and live.\n\nAnother year passed away with increasing apprehensions. Ann had a hectic\ncough, and many unfavourable prognostics: Mary then forgot every thing\nbut the fear of losing her, and even imagined that her recovery would\nhave made her happy.\n\nHer anxiety led her to study physic, and for some time she only read\nbooks of that cast; and this knowledge, literally speaking, ended in\nvanity and vexation of spirit, as it enabled her to foresee what she\ncould not prevent.\n\nAs her mind expanded, her marriage appeared a dreadful misfortune; she\nwas sometimes reminded of the heavy yoke, and bitter was the\nrecollection!\n\nIn one thing there seemed to be a sympathy between them, for she wrote\nformal answers to his as formal letters. An extreme dislike took root in\nher mind; the found of his name made her turn sick; but she forgot all,\nlistening to Ann's cough, and supporting her languid frame. She would\nthen catch her to her bosom with convulsive eagerness, as if to save her\nfrom sinking into an opening grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n\nIt was the will of Providence that Mary should experience almost every\nspecies of sorrow. Her father was thrown from his horse, when his blood\nwas in a very inflammatory state, and the bruises were very dangerous;\nhis recovery was not expected by the physical tribe.\n\nTerrified at seeing him so near death, and yet so ill prepared for it,\nhis daughter sat by his bed, oppressed by the keenest anguish, which her\npiety increased.\n\nHer grief had nothing selfish in it; he was not a friend or protector;\nbut he was her father, an unhappy wretch, going into eternity, depraved\nand thoughtless. Could a life of sensuality be a preparation for a\npeaceful death? Thus meditating, she passed the still midnight hour by\nhis bedside.\n\nThe nurse fell asleep, nor did a violent thunder storm interrupt her\nrepose, though it made the night appear still more terrific to Mary. Her\nfather's unequal breathing alarmed her, when she heard a long drawn\nbreath, she feared it was his last, and watching for another, a dreadful\npeal of thunder struck her ears. Considering the separation of the soul\nand body, this night seemed sadly solemn, and the hours long.\n\nDeath is indeed a king of terrors when he attacks the vicious man! The\ncompassionate heart finds not any comfort; but dreads an eternal\nseparation. No transporting greetings are anticipated, when the\nsurvivors also shall have finished their course; but all is black!--the\ngrave may truly be said to receive the departed--this is the sting of\ndeath!\n\nNight after night Mary watched, and this excessive fatigue impaired her\nown health, but had a worse effect on Ann; though she constantly went to\nbed, she could not rest; a number of uneasy thoughts obtruded\nthemselves; and apprehensions about Mary, whom she loved as well as her\nexhausted heart could love, harassed her mind. After a sleepless,\nfeverish night she had a violent fit of coughing, and burst a\nblood-vessel. The physician, who was in the house, was sent for, and\nwhen he left the patient, Mary, with an authoritative voice, insisted on\nknowing his real opinion. Reluctantly he gave it, that her friend was in\na critical state; and if she passed the approaching winter in England,\nhe imagined she would die in the spring; a season fatal to consumptive\ndisorders. The spring!--Her husband was then expected.--Gracious Heaven,\ncould she bear all this.\n\nIn a few days her father breathed his last. The horrid sensations his\ndeath occasioned were too poignant to be durable: and Ann's danger, and\nher own situation, made Mary deliberate what mode of conduct she should\npursue. She feared this event might hasten the return of her husband,\nand prevent her putting into execution a plan she had determined on. It\nwas to accompany Ann to a more salubrious climate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n\nI mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.\n\nDetermined on going to the South of France, or Lisbon; she wrote to the\nman she had promised to obey. The physicians had said change of air was\nnecessary for her as well as her friend. She mentioned this, and added,\n\"Her comfort, almost her existence, depended on the recovery of the\ninvalid she wished to attend; and that should she neglect to follow the\nmedical advice she had received, she should never forgive herself, or\nthose who endeavoured to prevent her.\" Full of her design, she wrote\nwith more than usual freedom; and this letter was like most of her\nothers, a transcript of her heart.\n\n\"This dear friend,\" she exclaimed, \"I love for her agreeable qualities,\nand substantial virtues. Continual attention to her health, and the\ntender office of a nurse, have created an affection very like a maternal\none--I am her only support, she leans on me--could I forsake the\nforsaken, and break the bruised reed--No--I would die first! I must--I\nwill go.\"\n\nShe would have added, \"you would very much oblige me by consenting;\" but\nher heart revolted--and irresolutely she wrote something about wishing\nhim happy.--\"Do I not wish all the world well?\" she cried, as she\nsubscribed her name--It was blotted, the letter sealed in a hurry, and\nsent out of her sight; and she began to prepare for her journey.\n\nBy the return of the post she received an answer; it contained some\ncommon-place remarks on her romantic friendship, as he termed it; \"But\nas the physicians advised change of air, he had no objection.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n\nThere was nothing now to retard their journey; and Mary chose Lisbon\nrather than France, on account of its being further removed from the\nonly person she wished not to see.\n\nThey set off accordingly for Falmouth, in their way to that city. The\njourney was of use to Ann, and Mary's spirits were raised by her\nrecovered looks--She had been in despair--now she gave way to hope, and\nwas intoxicated with it. On ship-board Ann always remained in the cabin;\nthe sight of the water terrified her: on the contrary, Mary, after she\nwas gone to bed, or when she fell asleep in the day, went on deck,\nconversed with the sailors, and surveyed the boundless expanse before\nher with delight. One instant she would regard the ocean, the next the\nbeings who braved its fury. Their insensibility and want of fear, she\ncould not name courage; their thoughtless mirth was quite of an animal\nkind, and their feelings as impetuous and uncertain as the element they\nplowed.\n\nThey had only been a week at sea when they hailed the rock of Lisbon,\nand the next morning anchored at the castle. After the customary visits,\nthey were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city; and\nwhile one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them\none of the ugly carriages peculiar to the country, they waited in the\nIrish convent, which is situated close to the Tagus.\n\nSome of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there\nwas a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred staying\nwith a nun she had entered into conversation with.\n\nOne of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; Mary was struck\nwith awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and\ntenderness flowed from her eyes. My Father, I thank thee! burst from\nher--words were inadequate to express her feelings. Silently, she\nsurveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces,\nstrange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.\n\nIn an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited\neternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any\none she loved near her, she was particularly sensible of the presence\nof her Almighty Friend.\n\nThe arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to\nconduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids.\nUnfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of\nrain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather\ncurtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter\nthemselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way,\nand Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's\nprecautions.\n\nAs is the custom, the rest of the invalids, or lodgers, sent to enquire\nafter their health; and as soon as Ann left her chamber, in which her\ncomplaints seldom confined her the whole day, they came in person to pay\ntheir compliments. Three fashionable females, and two gentlemen; the\none a brother of the eldest of the young ladies, and the other an\ninvalid, who came, like themselves, for the benefit of the air. They\nentered into conversation immediately.\n\nPeople who meet in a strange country, and are all together in a house,\nsoon get acquainted, without the formalities which attend visiting in\nseparate houses, where they are surrounded by domestic friends. Ann was\nparticularly delighted at meeting with agreeable society; a little\nhectic fever generally made her low-spirited in the morning, and lively\nin the evening, when she wished for company. Mary, who only thought of\nher, determined to cultivate their acquaintance, as she knew, that if\nher mind could be diverted, her body might gain strength.\n\nThey were all musical, and proposed having little concerts. One of the\ngentlemen played on the violin, and the other on the german-flute. The\ninstruments were brought in, with all the eagerness that attends putting\na new scheme in execution.\n\nMary had not said much, for she was diffident; she seldom joined in\ngeneral conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her\nsoon to enter into the characters of those she conversed with; and her\nsensibility made her desirous of pleasing every human creature. Besides,\nif her mind was not occupied by any particular sorrow, or study, she\ncaught reflected pleasure, and was glad to see others happy, though\ntheir mirth did not interest her.\n\nThis day she was continually thinking of Ann's recovery, and encouraging\nthe cheerful hopes, which though they dissipated the spirits that had\nbeen condensed by melancholy, yet made her wish to be silent. The music,\nmore than the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first.\nThe gentleman who played on the german-flute, was a handsome, well-bred,\nsensible man; and his observations, if not original, were pertinent.\n\nThe other, who had not said much, began to touch the violin, and played\na little Scotch ballad; he brought such a thrilling sound out of the\ninstrument, that Mary started, and looking at him with more attention\nthan she had done before, and saw, in a face rather ugly, strong lines\nof genius. His manners were awkward, that kind of awkwardness which is\noften found in literary men: he seemed a thinker, and delivered his\nopinions in elegant expressions, and musical tones of voice.\n\nWhen the concert was over, they all retired to their apartments. Mary\nalways slept with Ann, as she was subject to terrifying dreams; and\nfrequently in the night was obliged to be supported, to avoid\nsuffocation. They chatted about their new acquaintance in their own\napartment, and, with respect to the gentlemen, differed in opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n\nEvery day almost they saw their new acquaintance; and civility produced\nintimacy. Mary sometimes left her friend with them; while she indulged\nherself in viewing new modes of life, and searching out the causes which\nproduced them. She had a metaphysical turn, which inclined her to\nreflect on every object that passed by her; and her mind was not like a\nmirror, which receives every floating image, but does not retain them:\nshe had not any prejudices, for every opinion was examined before it was\nadopted.\n\nThe Roman Catholic ceremonies attracted her attention, and gave rise to\nconversations when they all met; and one of the gentlemen continually\nintroduced deistical notions, when he ridiculed the pageantry they all\nwere surprised at observing. Mary thought of both the subjects, the\nRomish tenets, and the deistical doubts; and though not a sceptic,\nthought it right to examine the evidence on which her faith was built.\nShe read Butler's Analogy, and some other authors: and these researches\nmade her a christian from conviction, and she learned charity,\nparticularly with respect to sectaries; saw that apparently good and\nsolid arguments might take their rise from different points of view; and\nshe rejoiced to find that those she should not concur with had some\nreason on their side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n\nWhen I mentioned the three ladies, I said they were fashionable women;\nand it was all the praise, as a faithful historian, I could bestow on\nthem; the only thing in which they were consistent. I forgot to mention\nthat they were all of one family, a mother, her daughter, and niece. The\ndaughter was sent by her physician, to avoid a northerly winter; the\nmother, her niece, and nephew, accompanied her.\n\nThey were people of rank; but unfortunately, though of an ancient\nfamily, the title had descended to a very remote branch--a branch they\ntook care to be intimate with; and servilely copied the Countess's\nairs. Their minds were shackled with a set of notions concerning\npropriety, the fitness of things for the world's eye, trammels which\nalways hamper weak people. What will the world say? was the first thing\nthat was thought of, when they intended doing any thing they had not\ndone before. Or what would the Countess do on such an occasion? And when\nthis question was answered, the right or wrong was discovered without\nthe trouble of their having any idea of the matter in their own heads.\nThis same Countess was a fine planet, and the satellites observed a most\nharmonic dance around her.\n\nAfter this account it is scarcely necessary to add, that their minds had\nreceived very little cultivation. They were taught French, Italian, and\nSpanish; English was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn?\nHamlet will tell you--words--words. But let me not forget that they\nsqualled Italian songs in the true _gusto_. Without having any seeds\nsown in their understanding, or the affections of the heart set to work,\nthey were brought out of their nursery, or the place they were secluded\nin, to prevent their faces being common; like blazing stars, to\ncaptivate Lords.\n\nThey were pretty, and hurrying from one party of pleasure to another,\noccasioned the disorder which required change of air. The mother, if we\nexcept her being near twenty years older, was just the same creature;\nand these additional years only served to make her more tenaciously\nadhere to her habits of folly, and decide with stupid gravity, some\ntrivial points of ceremony, as a matter of the last importance; of\nwhich she was a competent judge, from having lived in the fashionable\nworld so long: that world to which the ignorant look up as we do to the\nsun.\n\nIt appears to me that every creature has some notion--or rather relish,\nof the sublime. Riches, and the consequent state, are the sublime of\nweak minds:--These images fill, nay, are too big for their narrow souls.\n\nOne afternoon, which they had engaged to spend together, Ann was so ill,\nthat Mary was obliged to send an apology for not attending the\ntea-table. The apology brought them on the carpet; and the mother, with\na look of solemn importance, turned to the sick man, whose name was\nHenry, and said;\n\n\"Though people of the first fashion are frequently at places of this\nkind, intimate with they know not who; yet I do not choose that my\ndaughter, whose family is so respectable, should be intimate with any\none she would blush to know elsewhere. It is only on that account, for I\nnever suffer her to be with any one but in my company,\" added she,\nsitting more erect; and a smile of self-complacency dressed her\ncountenance.\n\n\"I have enquired concerning these strangers, and find that the one who\nhas the most dignity in her manners, is really a woman of fortune.\"\n\"Lord, mamma, how ill she dresses:\" mamma went on; \"She is a romantic\ncreature, you must not copy her, miss; yet she is an heiress of the\nlarge fortune in ----shire, of which you may remember to have heard the\nCountess speak the night you had on the dancing-dress that was so much\nadmired; but she is married.\"\n\nShe then told them the whole story as she heard it from her maid, who\npicked it out of Mary's servant. \"She is a foolish creature, and this\nfriend that she pays as much attention to as if she was a lady of\nquality, is a beggar.\" \"Well, how strange!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"She is, however, a charming creature,\" said her nephew. Henry sighed,\nand strode across the room once or twice; then took up his violin, and\nplayed the air which first struck Mary; he had often heard her praise\nit.\n\nThe music was uncommonly melodious, \"And came stealing on the senses\nlike the sweet south.\" The well-known sounds reached Mary as she sat by\nher friend--she listened without knowing that she did--and shed tears\nalmost without being conscious of it. Ann soon fell asleep, as she had\ntaken an opiate. Mary, then brooding over her fears, began to imagine\nshe had deceived herself--Ann was still very ill; hope had beguiled many\nheavy hours; yet she was displeased with herself for admitting this\nwelcome guest.--And she worked up her mind to such a degree of anxiety,\nthat she determined, once more, to seek medical aid.\n\nNo sooner did she determine, than she ran down with a discomposed look,\nto enquire of the ladies who she should send for. When she entered the\nroom she could not articulate her fears--it appeared like pronouncing\nAnn's sentence of death; her faultering tongue dropped some broken\nwords, and she remained silent. The ladies wondered that a person of her\nsense should be so little mistress of herself; and began to administer\nsome common-place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the\nwill of Heaven, and the like trite consolations, which Mary did not\nanswer; but waving her hand, with an air of impatience, she exclaimed,\n\"I cannot live without her!--I have no other friend; if I lose her, what\na desart will the world be to me.\" \"No other friend,\" re-echoed they,\n\"have you not a husband?\"\n\nMary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of\npropriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered\nreason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed\nmanner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room. Henry's eyes\nfollowed her while the females very freely animadverted on her strange\nbehaviour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n\nThe physician was sent for; his prescription afforded Ann a little\ntemporary relief; and they again joined the circle. Unfortunately, the\nweather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined\nthem to the house. Ann then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they\nsat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted; and,\nbut for cards or music, the long evenings would have been yawned away in\nlistless indolence.\n\nThe bad weather had had as ill an effect on Henry as on Ann. He was\nfrequently very thoughtful, or rather melancholy; this melancholy would\nof itself have attracted Mary's notice, if she had not found his\nconversation so infinitely superior to the rest of the group. When she\nconversed with him, all the faculties of her soul unfolded themselves;\ngenius animated her expressive countenance and the most graceful,\nunaffected gestures gave energy to her discourse.\n\nThey frequently discussed very important subjects, while the rest were\nsinging or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as Henry,\nwhom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all\nmore attention than her. Besides, as there was nothing alluring in her\ndress or manner, they never dreamt of her being preferred to them.\n\nHenry was a man of learning; he had also studied mankind, and knew many\nof the intricacies of the human heart, from having felt the infirmities\nof his own. His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he\nobserved with a critical eye. Mary could not help thinking that in his\ncompany her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She\nincreased her stock of ideas, and her taste was improved.\n\nHe was also a pious man; his rational religious sentiments received\nwarmth from his sensibility; and, except on very particular occasions,\nkept it in proper bounds; these sentiments had likewise formed his\ntemper; he was gentle, and easily to be intreated. The ridiculous\nceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed\ngrave subjects, and made him explain his opinions, which, at other\ntimes, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to\nnotice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n\nWhen the weather began to clear up, Mary sometimes rode out alone,\npurposely to view the ruins that still remained of the earthquake: or\nshe would ride to the banks of the Tagus, to feast her eyes with the\nsight of that magnificent river. At other times she would visit the\nchurches, as she was particularly fond of seeing historical paintings.\n\nOne of these visits gave rise to the subject, and the whole party\ndescanted on it; but as the ladies could not handle it well, they soon\nadverted to portraits; and talked of the attitudes and characters in\nwhich they should wish to be drawn. Mary did not fix on one--when\nHenry, with more apparent warmth than usual, said, \"I would give the\nworld for your picture, with the expression I have seen in your face,\nwhen you have been supporting your friend.\"\n\nThis delicate compliment did not gratify her vanity, but it reached her\nheart. She then recollected that she had once sat for her picture--for\nwhom was it designed? For a boy! Her cheeks flushed with indignation, so\nstrongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at having been thrown\naway--given in with an estate.\n\nAs Mary again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged; and her\nthoughts were employed about the objects around her.\n\nShe visited several convents, and found that solitude only eradicates\nsome passions, to give strength to others; the most baneful ones. She\nsaw that religion does not consist in ceremonies; and that many prayers\nmay fall from the lips without purifying the heart.\n\nThey who imagine they can be religious without governing their tempers,\nor exercising benevolence in its most extensive sense, must certainly\nallow, that their religious duties are only practiced from selfish\nprinciples; how then can they be called good? The pattern of all\ngoodness went about _doing_ good. Wrapped up in themselves, the nuns\nonly thought of inferior gratifications. And a number of intrigues were\ncarried on to accelerate certain points on which their hearts were\nfixed:\n\nSuch as obtaining offices of trust or authority; or avoiding those that\nwere servile or laborious. In short, when they could be neither wives\nnor mothers, they aimed at being superiors, and became the most selfish\ncreatures in the world: the passions that were curbed gave strength to\nthe appetites, or to those mean passions which only tend to provide for\nthe gratification of them. Was this seclusion from the world? or did\nthey conquer its vanities or avoid its vexations?\n\nIn these abodes the unhappy individual, who, in the first paroxysm of\ngrief flies to them for refuge, finds too late she took a wrong step.\nThe same warmth which determined her will make her repent; and sorrow,\nthe rust of the mind, will never have a chance of being rubbed off by\nsensible conversation, or new-born affections of the heart.\n\nShe will find that those affections that have once been called forth and\nstrengthened by exercise, are only smothered, not killed, by\ndisappointment; and that in one form or other discontent will corrode\nthe heart, and produce those maladies of the imagination, for which\nthere is no specific.\n\nThe community at large Mary disliked; but pitied many of them whose\nprivate distresses she was informed of; and to pity and relieve were the\nsame things with her.\n\nThe exercise of her various virtues gave vigor to her genius, and\ndignity to her mind; she was sometimes inconsiderate, and violent; but\nnever mean or cunning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n\nThe Portuguese are certainly the most uncivilized nation in Europe. Dr.\nJohnson would have said, \"They have the least mind.\". And can such serve\ntheir Creator in spirit and in truth? No, the gross ritual of Romish\nceremonies is all they can comprehend: they can do penance, but not\nconquer their revenge, or lust. Religion, or love, has never humanized\ntheir hearts; they want the vital part; the mere body worships. Taste is\nunknown; Gothic finery, and unnatural decorations, which they term\nornaments, are conspicuous in their churches and dress. Reverence for\nmental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation.\n\nCould the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary's heart? No: she\nturned disgusted from the prospects--turned to a man of refinement.\nHenry had been some time ill and low-spirited; Mary would have been\nattentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly\nso; she thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his constant\nendeavours to amuse Ann, and prevent her dwelling on the dreary prospect\nbefore her, which sometimes she could not help anticipating with a kind\nof quiet despair.\n\nShe found some excuse for going more frequently into the room they all\nmet in; nay, she avowed her desire to amuse him: offered to read to him,\nand tried to draw him into amusing conversations; and when she was full\nof these little schemes, she looked at him with a degree of tenderness\nthat she was not conscious of. This divided attention was of use to her,\nand prevented her continually thinking of Ann, whose fluctuating\ndisorder often gave rise to false hopes.\n\nA trifling thing occurred now which occasioned Mary some uneasiness. Her\nmaid, a well-looking girl, had captivated the clerk of a neighbouring\ncompting-house. As the match was an advantageous one, Mary could not\nraise any objection to it, though at this juncture it was very\ndisagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person. However, the\ngirl consented to delay the marriage, as she had some affection for her\nmistress; and, besides, looked forward to Ann's death as a time of\nharvest.\n\nHenry's illness was not alarming, it was rather pleasing, as it gave\nMary an excuse to herself for shewing him how much she was interested\nabout him; and giving little artless proofs of affection, which the\npurity of her heart made her never wish to restrain.\n\nThe only visible return he made was not obvious to common observers. He\nwould sometimes fix his eyes on her, and take them off with a sigh that\nwas coughed away; or when he was leisurely walking into the room, and\ndid not expect to see her, he would quicken his steps, and come up to\nher with eagerness to ask some trivial question. In the same style, he\nwould try to detain her when he had nothing to say--or said nothing.\n\nAnn did not take notice of either his or Mary's behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary's pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, \"That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n\nOne morning they set out to visit the aqueduct; though the day was very\nfine when they left home, a very heavy shower fell before they reached\nit; they lengthened their ride, the clouds dispersed, and the sun came\nfrom behind them uncommonly bright.\n\nMary would fain have persuaded Ann not to have left the carriage; but\nshe was in spirits, and obviated all her objections, and insisted on\nwalking, tho' the ground was damp. But her strength was not equal to her\nspirits; she was soon obliged to return to the carriage so much\nfatigued, that she fainted, and remained insensible a long time.\n\nHenry would have supported her; but Mary would not permit him; her\nrecollection was instantaneous, and she feared sitting on the damp\nground might do him a material injury: she was on that account positive,\nthough the company did not guess the cause of her being so. As to\nherself, she did not fear bodily pain; and, when her mind was agitated,\nshe could endure the greatest fatigue without appearing sensible of it.\n\nWhen Ann recovered, they returned slowly home; she was carried to bed,\nand the next morning Mary thought she observed a visible change for the\nworse. The physician was sent for, who pronounced her to be in the most\nimminent danger.\n\nAll Mary's former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every\nother care away; she even added to her present anguish by upbraiding\nherself for her late tranquillity--it haunted her in the form of a\ncrime.\n\nThe disorder made the most rapid advances--there was no hope!--Bereft of\nit, Mary again was tranquil; but it was a very different kind of\ntranquillity. She stood to brave the approaching storm, conscious she\nonly could be overwhelmed by it.\n\nShe did not think of Henry, or if her thoughts glanced towards him, it\nwas only to find fault with herself for suffering a thought to have\nstrayed from Ann.--Ann!--this dear friend was soon torn from her--she\ndied suddenly as Mary was assisting her to walk across the room.--The\nfirst string was severed from her heart--and this \"slow, sudden-death\"\ndisturbed her reasoning faculties; she seemed stunned by it; unable to\nreflect, or even to feel her misery.\n\nThe body was stolen out of the house the second night, and Mary refused\nto see her former companions. She desired her maid to conclude her\nmarriage, and request her intended husband to inform her when the first\nmerchantman was to leave the port, as the packet had just sailed, and\nshe determined not to stay in that hated place any longer than was\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nShe then sent to request the ladies to visit her; she wished to avoid a\nparade of grief--her sorrows were her own, and appeared to her not to\nadmit of increase or softening. She was right; the sight of them did not\naffect her, or turn the stream of her sullen sorrow; the black wave\nrolled along in the same course, it was equal to her where she cast her\neyes; all was impenetrable gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n\nSoon after the ladies left her, she received a message from Henry,\nrequesting, as she saw company, to be permitted to visit her: she\nconsented, and he entered immediately, with an unassured pace. She ran\neagerly up to him--saw the tear trembling in his eye, and his\ncountenance softened by the tenderest compassion; the hand which pressed\nhers seemed that of a fellow-creature. She burst into tears; and, unable\nto restrain them, she hid her face with both her hands; these tears\nrelieved her, (she had before had a difficulty in breathing,) and she\nsat down by him more composed than she had appeared since Ann's death;\nbut her conversation was incoherent.\n\nShe called herself \"a poor disconsolate creature!\"--\"Mine is a selfish\ngrief,\" she exclaimed--\"Yet; Heaven is my witness, I do not wish her\nback now she has reached those peaceful mansions, where the weary rest.\nHer pure spirit is happy; but what a wretch am I!\"\n\nHenry forgot his cautious reserve. \"Would you allow me to call you\nfriend?\" said he in a hesitating voice. \"I feel, dear girl, the tendered\ninterest in whatever concerns thee.\" His eyes spoke the rest. They were\nboth silent a few moments; then Henry resumed the conversation. \"I have\nalso been acquainted with grief! I mourn the loss of a woman who was not\nworthy of my regard. Let me give thee some account of the man who now\nsolicits thy friendship; and who, from motives of the purest\nbenevolence, wishes to give comfort to thy wounded heart.\"\n\n\"I have myself,\" said he, mournfully, \"shaken hands with happiness, and\nam dead to the world; I wait patiently for my dissolution; but, for\nthee, Mary, there may be many bright days in store.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" replied she, in a peevish tone, as if he had insulted her\nby the supposition; her feelings were so much in unison with his, that\nshe was in love with misery.\n\nHe smiled at her impatience, and went on. \"My father died before I knew\nhim, and my mother was so attached to my eldest brother, that she took\nvery little pains to fit me for the profession to which I was destined:\nand, may I tell thee, I left my family, and, in many different stations,\nrambled about the world; saw mankind in every rank of life; and, in\norder to be independent, exerted those talents Nature has given me:\nthese exertions improved my understanding; and the miseries I was\nwitness to, gave a keener edge to my sensibility. My constitution is\nnaturally weak; and, perhaps, two or three lingering disorders in my\nyouth, first gave me a habit of reflecting, and enabled me to obtain\nsome dominion over my passions. At least,\" added he, stifling a sigh,\n\"over the violent ones, though I fear, refinement and reflection only\nrenders the tender ones more tyrannic.\n\n\"I have told you already I have been in love, and disappointed--the\nobject is now no more; let her faults sleep with her! Yet this passion\nhas pervaded my whole soul, and mixed itself with all my affections and\npursuits.--I am not peacefully indifferent; yet it is only to my violin\nI tell the sorrows I now confide with thee. The object I loved forfeited\nmy esteem; yet, true to the sentiment, my fancy has too frequently\ndelighted to form a creature that I could love, that could convey to my\nsoul sensations which the gross part of mankind have not any conception\nof.\"\n\nHe stopped, as Mary seemed lost in thought; but as she was still in a\nlistening attitude, continued his little narrative. \"I kept up an\nirregular correspondence with my mother; my brother's extravagance and\ningratitude had almost broken her heart, and made her feel something\nlike a pang of remorse, on account of her behaviour to me. I hastened to\ncomfort her--and was a comfort to her.\n\n\"My declining health prevented my taking orders, as I had intended; but\nI with warmth entered into literary pursuits; perhaps my heart, not\nhaving an object, made me embrace the substitute with more eagerness.\nBut, do not imagine I have always been a die-away swain. No: I have\nfrequented the cheerful haunts of men, and wit!--enchanting wit! has\nmade many moments fly free from care. I am too fond of the elegant arts;\nand woman--lovely woman! thou hast charmed me, though, perhaps, it would\nnot be easy to find one to whom my reason would allow me to be constant.\n\n\"I have now only to tell you, that my mother insisted on my spending\nthis winter in a warmer climate; and I fixed on Lisbon, as I had before\nvisited the Continent.\" He then looked Mary full in the face; and, with\nthe most insinuating accents, asked \"if he might hope for her\nfriendship? If she would rely on him as if he was her father; and that\nthe tenderest father could not more anxiously interest himself in the\nfate of a darling child, than he did in her's.\"\n\nSuch a crowd of thoughts all at once rushed into Mary's mind, that she\nin vain attempted to express the sentiments which were most predominant.\nHer heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it:\naccustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfortless, if\nnot engrossed by a particular affection.\n\nHenry saw her distress, and not to increase it, left the room. He had\nexerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had\nsucceeded; she thought of him till she began to chide herself for\ndefrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on\nHenry's misfortunes and ill health; and the interest he took in her fate\nwas a balm to her sick mind. She did not reason on the subject; but she\nfelt he was attached to her: lost in this delirium, she never asked\nherself what kind of an affection she had for him, or what it tended to;\nnor did she know that love and friendship are very distinct; she thought\nwith rapture, that there was one person in the world who had an\naffection for her, and that person she admired--had a friendship for.\n\nHe had called her his dear girl; the words might have fallen from him by\naccident; but they did not fall to the ground. My child! His child,\nwhat an association of ideas! If I had had a father, such a father!--She\ncould not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves.\nHer mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.\nLost, in waking dreams, she considered and reconsidered Henry's account\nof himself; till she actually thought she would tell Ann--a bitter\nrecollection then roused her out of her reverie; and aloud she begged\nforgiveness of her.\n\nBy these kind of conflicts the day was lengthened; and when she went to\nbed, the night passed away in feverish slumbers; though they did not\nrefresh her, she was spared the labour of thinking, of restraining her\nimagination; it sported uncontrouled; but took its colour from her\nwaking train of thoughts. One instant she was supporting her dying\nmother; then Ann was breathing her last, and Henry was comforting her.\n\nThe unwelcome light visited her languid eyes; yet, I must tell the\ntruth, she thought she should see Henry, and this hope set her spirits\nin motion: but they were quickly depressed by her maid, who came to tell\nher that she had heard of a vessel on board of which she could be\naccommodated, and that there was to be another female passenger on\nboard, a vulgar one; but perhaps she would be more useful on that\naccount--Mary did not want a companion.\n\nAs she had given orders for her passage to be engaged in the first\nvessel that sailed, she could not now retract; and must prepare for the\nlonely voyage, as the Captain intended taking advantage of the first\nfair wind. She had too much strength of mind to waver in her\ndetermination but to determine wrung her very heart, opened all her old\nwounds, and made them bleed afresh. What was she to do? where go? Could\nshe set a seal to a hasty vow, and tell a deliberate lie; promise to\nlove one man, when the image of another was ever present to her--her\nsoul revolted. \"I might gain the applause of the world by such mock\nheroism; but should I not forfeit my own? forfeit thine, my father!\"\n\nThere is a solemnity in the shortest ejaculation, which, for a while,\nstills the tumult of passion. Mary's mind had been thrown off its poise;\nher devotion had been, perhaps, more fervent for some time past; but\nless regular. She forgot that happiness was not to be found on earth,\nand built a terrestrial paradise liable to be destroyed by the first\nserious thought: when, she reasoned she became inexpressibly sad, to\nrender life bearable she gave way to fancy--this was madness.\n\nIn a few days she must again go to sea; the weather was very\ntempestuous--what of that, the tempest in her soul rendered every other\ntrifling--it was not the contending elements, but _herself_ she feared!\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n\nIn order to gain strength to support the expected interview, she went\nout in a carriage. The day was fine; but all nature was to her a\nuniversal blank; she could neither enjoy it, nor weep that she could\nnot. She passed by the ruins of an old monastery on a very high hill she\ngot out to walk amongst the ruins; the wind blew violently, she did not\navoid its fury, on the contrary, wildly bid it blow on, and seemed glad\nto contend with it, or rather walk against it. Exhausted she returned to\nthe carriage was soon at home, and in the old room.\n\nHenry started at the sight of her altered appearance; the day before her\ncomplexion had been of the most pallid hue; but now her cheeks were\nflushed, and her eyes enlivened with a false vivacity, an unusual fire.\nHe was not well, his illness was apparent in his countenance, and he\nowned he had not closed his eyes all night; this roused her dormant\ntenderness, she forgot they were so soon to part-engrossed by the\npresent happiness of seeing, of hearing him.\n\nOnce or twice she essayed to tell him that she was, in a few days, to\ndepart; but she could not; she was irresolute; it will do to-morrow;\nshould the wind change they could not sail in such a hurry; thus she\nthought, and insensibly grew more calm. The Ladies prevailed on her to\nspend the evening with them; but she retired very early to rest, and sat\non the side of her bed several hours, then threw herself on it, and\nwaited for the dreaded to-morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n\nThe ladies heard that her servant was to be married that day, and that\nshe was to sail in the vessel which was then clearing out at the\nCustom-house. Henry heard, but did not make any remarks; and Mary called\nup all her fortitude to support her, and enable her to hide from the\nfemales her internal struggles. She durst not encounter Henry's glances\nwhen she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to\ndraw a veil over her wretched state of mind, she talked incessantly, she\nknew not what; flashes of wit burst from her, and when she began to\nlaugh she could not stop herself.\n\nHenry smiled at some of her sallies, and looked at her with such\nbenignity and compassion, that he recalled her scattered thoughts; and,\nthe ladies going to dress for dinner, they were left alone; and remained\nsilent a few moments: after the noisy conversation it appeared solemn.\nHenry began. \"You are going, Mary, and going by yourself; your mind is\nnot in a state to be left to its own operations--yet I cannot, dissuade\nyou; if I attempted to do it, I should ill deserve the title I wish to\nmerit. I only think of your happiness; could I obey the strongest\nimpulse of my heart, I should accompany thee to England; but such a step\nmight endanger your future peace.\"\n\nMary, then, with all the frankness which marked her character, explained\nher situation to him and mentioned her fatal tie with such disgust that\nhe trembled for her. \"I cannot see him; he is not the man formed for me\nto love!\" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her\nhusband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did she\nnot fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him? and if Ann\nhad been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some\nremote corner to have escaped from him.\n\n\"I intend,\" said Henry, \"to follow you in the next packet; where shall I\nhear of your health?\" \"Oh! let me hear of thine,\" replied Mary. \"I am\nwell, very well; but thou art very ill--thy health is in the most\nprecarious state.\" She then mentioned her intention of going to Ann's\nrelations. \"I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her:\nduring my voyage I have time enough for reflection; though I think I\nhave already determined.\"\n\n\"Be not too hasty, my child,\" interrupted Henry; \"far be it from me to\npersuade thee to do violence to thy feelings--but consider that all thy\nfuture life may probably take its colour from thy present mode of\nconduct. Our affections as well as our sentiments are fluctuating; you\nwill not perhaps always either think or feel as you do at present: the\nobject you now shun may appear in a different light.\" He paused. \"In\nadvising thee in this style, I have only thy good at heart, Mary.\"\n\nShe only answered to expostulate. \"My affections are involuntary--yet\nthey can only be fixed by reflection, and when they are they make quite\na part of my soul, are interwoven in it, animate my actions, and form\nmy taste: certain qualities are calculated to call forth my sympathies,\nand make me all I am capable of being. The governing affection gives its\nstamp to the rest--because I am capable of loving one, I have that kind\nof charity to all my fellow-creatures which is not easily provoked.\nMilton has asserted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly\nwe may ascend.\"\n\nShe went on with eagerness. \"My opinions on some subjects are not\nwavering; my pursuit through life has ever been the same: in solitude\nwere my sentiments formed; they are indelible, and nothing can efface\nthem but death--No, death itself cannot efface them, or my soul must be\ncreated afresh, and not improved. Yet a little while am I parted from\nmy Ann--I could not exist without the hope of seeing her again--I could\nnot bear to think that time could wear away an affection that was\nfounded on what is not liable to perish; you might as well attempt to\npersuade me that my soul is matter, and that its feelings arose from\ncertain modifications of it.\"\n\n\"Dear enthusiastic creature,\" whispered Henry, \"how you steal into my\nsoul.\" She still continued. \"The same turn of mind which leads me to\nadore the Author of all Perfection--which leads me to conclude that he\nonly can fill my soul; forces me to admire the faint image-the shadows\nof his attributes here below; and my imagination gives still bolder\nstrokes to them. I knew I am in some degree under the influence of a\ndelusion--but does not this strong delusion prove that I myself 'am _of\nsubtiler essence than the trodden clod_' these flights of the\nimagination point to futurity; I cannot banish them. Every cause in\nnature produces an effect; and am I an exception to the general rule?\nhave I desires implanted in me only to make me miserable? will they\nnever be gratified? shall I never be happy? My feelings do not accord\nwith the notion of solitary happiness. In a state of bliss, it will be\nthe society of beings we can love, without the alloy that earthly\ninfirmities mix with our best affections, that will constitute great\npart of our happiness.\n\n\"With these notions can I conform to the maxims of worldly wisdom? can\nI listen to the cold dictates of worldly prudence and bid my tumultuous\npassions cease to vex me, be still, find content in grovelling pursuits,\nand the admiration of the misjudging crowd, when it is only one I wish\nto please--one who could be all the world to me. Argue not with me, I am\nbound by human ties; but did my spirit ever promise to love, or could I\nconsider when forced to bind myself--to take a vow, that at the awful\nday of judgment I must give an account of. My conscience does not smite\nme, and that Being who is greater than the internal monitor, may approve\nof what the world condemns; sensible that in Him I live, could I brave\nHis presence, or hope in solitude to find peace, if I acted contrary to\nconviction, that the world might approve of my conduct--what could the\nworld give to compensate for my own esteem? it is ever hostile and armed\nagainst the feeling heart!\n\n\"Riches and honours await me, and the cold moralist might desire me to\nsit down and enjoy them--I cannot conquer my feelings, and till I do,\nwhat are these baubles to me? you may tell me I follow a fleeting good,\nan _ignis fatuus_; but this chase, these struggles prepare me for\neternity--when I no longer see through a glass darkly I shall not reason\nabout, but _feel_ in what happiness consists.\"\n\nHenry had not attempted to interrupt her; he saw she was determined, and\nthat these sentiments were not the effusion of the moment, but well\ndigested ones, the result of strong affections, a high sense of honour,\nand respect for the source of all virtue and truth. He was startled, if\nnot entirely convinced by her arguments; indeed her voice, her gestures\nwere all persuasive.\n\nSome one now entered the room; he looked an answer to her long harangue;\nit was fortunate for him, or he might have been led to say what in a\ncooler moment he had determined to conceal; but were words necessary to\nreveal it? He wished not to influence her conduct--vain precaution; she\nknew she was beloved; and could she forget that such a man loved her, or\nrest satisfied with any inferior gratification. When passion first\nenters the heart, it is only a return of affection that is sought after,\nand every other remembrance and wish is blotted out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n\nTwo days passed away without any particular conversation; Henry, trying\nto be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever. The\nconflict was too violent for his present state of health; the spirit was\nwilling, but the body suffered; he lost his appetite, and looked\nwretchedly; his spirits were calmly low--the world seemed to fade\naway--what was that world to him that Mary did not inhabit; she lived\nnot for him.\n\nHe was mistaken; his affection was her only support; without this dear\nprop she had sunk into the grave of her lost--long-loved friend;--his\nattention snatched her from despair. Inscrutable are the ways of\nHeaven!\n\nThe third day Mary was desired to prepare herself; for if the wind\ncontinued in the same point, they should set sail the next evening. She\ntried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not useless she appeared\nless agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage\nwith composure. On great occasions she was generally calm and collected,\nher resolution would brace her unstrung nerves; but after the victory\nshe had no triumph; she would sink into a state of moping melancholy,\nand feel ten-fold misery when the heroic enthusiasm was over.\n\nThe morning of the day fixed on for her departure she was alone with\nHenry only a few moments, and an awkward kind of formality made them\nslip away without their having said much to each other. Henry was\nafraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but\nfriendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever breaking\nout-while she as artlessly expressed again and again, her fears with\nrespect to his declining health.\n\n\"We shall soon meet,\" said he, with a faint smile; Mary smiled too; she\ncaught the sickly beam; it was still fainter by being reflected, and not\nknowing what she wished to do, started up and left the room. When she\nwas alone she regretted she had left him so precipitately. \"The few\nprecious moments I have thus thrown away may never return,\" she\nthought-the reflection led to misery.\n\nShe waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could\nnot avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and Henry; and\nthe trivial conversations she was obliged to bear a part in harassed her\nmore than can be well conceived.\n\nThe summons came, and the whole party attended her to the vessel. For a\nwhile the remembrance of Ann banished her regret at parting with Henry,\nthough his pale figure pressed on her sight; it may seem a paradox, but\nhe was more present to her when she sailed; her tears then were all his\nown.\n\n\"My poor Ann!\" thought Mary, \"along this road we came, and near this\nspot you called me your guardian angel--and now I leave thee here! ah!\nno, I do not--thy spirit is not confined to its mouldering tenement!\nTell me, thou soul of her I love, tell me, ah! whither art thou fled?\"\nAnn occupied her until they reached the ship.\n\nThe anchor was weighed. Nothing can be more irksome than waiting to say\nfarewel. As the day was serene, they accompanied her a little way, and\nthen got into the boat; Henry was the last; he pressed her hand, it had\nnot any life in it; she leaned over the side of the ship without looking\nat the boat, till it was so far distant, that she could not see the\ncountenances of those that were in it: a mist spread itself over her\nsight--she longed to exchange one look--tried to recollect the\nlast;--the universe contained no being but Henry!--The grief of parting\nwith him had swept all others clean away. Her eyes followed the keel of\nthe boat, and when she could no longer perceive its traces: she looked\nround on the wide waste of waters, thought of the precious moments\nwhich had been stolen from the waste of murdered time.\n\nShe then descended into the cabin, regardless of the surrounding\nbeauties of nature, and throwing herself on her bed in the little hole\nwhich was called the state-room--she wished to forget her existence. On\nthis bed she remained two days, listening to the dashing waves, unable\nto close her eyes. A small taper made the darkness visible; and the\nthird night, by its glimmering light, she wrote the following fragment.\n\n\"Poor solitary wretch that I am; here alone do I listen to the whistling\nwinds and dashing waves;--on no human support can I rest--when not lost\nto hope I found pleasure in the society of those rough beings; but now\nthey appear not like my fellow creatures; no social ties draw me to\nthem. How long, how dreary has this day been; yet I scarcely wish it\nover--for what will to-morrow bring--to-morrow, and to-morrow will only\nbe marked with unvaried characters of wretchedness.--Yet surely, I am\nnot alone!\"\n\nHer moistened eyes were lifted up to heaven; a crowd of thoughts darted\ninto her mind, and pressing her hand against her forehead, as if to bear\nthe intellectual weight, she tried, but tried in vain, to arrange them.\n\"Father of Mercies, compose this troubled spirit: do I indeed wish it to\nbe composed--to forget my Henry?\" the _my_, the pen was directly drawn\nacross in an agony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n\nThe mate of the ship, who heard her stir, came to offer her some\nrefreshment; and she, who formerly received every offer of kindness or\ncivility with pleasure, now shrunk away disgusted: peevishly she desired\nhim not to disturb her; but the words were hardly articulated when her\nheart smote her, she called him back, and requested something to drink.\nAfter drinking it, fatigued by her mental exertions, she fell into a\ndeath-like slumber, which lasted some hours; but did not refresh her, on\nthe contrary, she awoke languid and stupid.\n\nThe wind still continued contrary; a week, a dismal week, had she\nstruggled with her sorrows; and the struggle brought on a slow fever,\nwhich sometimes gave her false spirits.\n\nThe winds then became very tempestuous, the Great Deep was troubled, and\nall the passengers appalled. Mary then left her bed, and went on deck,\nto survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present\nstate of her soul; she thought in a few hours I may go home; the\nprisoner may be released. The vessel rose on a wave and descended into a\nyawning gulph--Not slower did her mounting soul return to earth,\nfor--Ah! her treasure and her heart was there. The squalls rattled\namongst the sails, which were quickly taken down; the wind would then\ndie away, and the wild undirected waves rushed on every side with a\ntremendous roar. In a little vessel in the midst of such a storm she\nwas not dismayed; she felt herself independent.\n\nJust then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of\na glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted\nabout, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm.\nMary's thoughts were now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of\ndestruction. They bore down to the wreck; they reached it, and hailed\nthe trembling wretches; at the sound of the friendly greeting, loud\ncries of tumultuous joy were mixed with the roaring of the waves, and\nwith ecstatic transport they leaped on the shattered deck, launched\ntheir boat in a moment, and committed themselves to the mercy of the\nsea. Stowed between two casks, and leaning on a sail, she watched the\nboat, and when a wave intercepted it from her view--she ceased to\nbreathe, or rather held her breath until it rose again.\n\nAt last the boat arrived safe along-side the ship, and Mary caught the\npoor trembling wretches as they stumbled into it, and joined them in\nthanking that gracious Being, who though He had not thought fit to still\nthe raging of the sea, had afforded them unexpected succour.\n\nAmongst the wretched crew was one poor woman, who fainted when she was\nhauled on board: Mary undressed her, and when she had recovered, and\nsoothed her, left her to enjoy the rest she required to recruit her\nstrength, which fear had quite exhausted. She returned again to view the\nangry deep; and when she gazed on its perturbed state, she thought of\nthe Being who rode on the wings of the wind, and stilled the noise of\nthe sea; and the madness of the people--He only could speak peace to\nher troubled spirit! she grew more calm; the late transaction had\ngratified her benevolence, and stole her out of herself.\n\nOne of the sailors, happening to say to another, \"that he believed the\nworld was going to be at an end;\" this observation led her into a new\ntrain of thoughts: some of Handel's sublime compositions occurred to\nher, and she sung them to the grand accompaniment. The Lord God\nOmnipotent reigned, and would reign for ever, and ever!--Why then did\nshe fear the sorrows that were passing away, when she knew that He would\nbind up the broken-hearted, and receive those who came out of great\ntribulation. She retired to her cabin; and wrote in the little book that\nwas now her only confident. It was after midnight.\n\n\"At this solemn hour, the great day of judgment fills my thoughts; the\nday of retribution, when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed;\nwhen all worldly distinctions will fade away, and be no more seen. I\nhave not words to express the sublime images which the bare\ncontemplation of this awful day raises in my mind. Then, indeed, the\nLord Omnipotent will reign, and He will wipe the tearful eye, and\nsupport the trembling heart--yet a little while He hideth his face, and\nthe dun shades of sorrow, and the thick clouds of folly separate us from\nour God; but when the glad dawn of an eternal day breaks, we shall know\neven as we are known. Here we walk by faith, and not by sight; and we\nhave this alternative, either to enjoy the pleasures of life which are\nbut for a season, or look forward to the prize of our high calling, and\nwith fortitude, and that wisdom which is from above, endeavour to bear\nthe warfare of life. We know that many run the race; but he that\nstriveth obtaineth the crown of victory. Our race is an arduous one! How\nmany are betrayed by traitors lodged in their own breasts, who wear the\ngarb of Virtue, and are so near akin; we sigh to think they should ever\nlead into folly, and slide imperceptibly into vice. Surely any thing\nlike happiness is madness! Shall probationers of an hour presume to\npluck the fruit of immortality, before they have conquered death? it is\nguarded, when the great day, to which I allude, arrives, the way will\nagain be opened. Ye dear delusions, gay deceits, farewel! and yet I\ncannot banish ye for ever; still does my panting soul push forward, and\nlive in futurity, in the deep shades o'er which darkness hangs.--I try\nto pierce the gloom, and find a resting-place, where my thirst of\nknowledge will be gratified, and my ardent affections find an object to\nfix them. Every thing material must change; happiness and this\nfluctating principle is not compatible. Eternity, immateriality, and\nhappiness,--what are ye? How shall I grasp the mighty and fleeting\nconceptions ye create?\"\n\nAfter writing, serenely she delivered her soul into the hands of the\nFather of Spirits; and slept in peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n\nMary rose early, refreshed by the seasonable rest, and went to visit the\npoor woman, whom she found quite recovered: and, on enquiry, heard that\nshe had lately buried her husband, a common sailor; and that her only\nsurviving child had been washed over-board the day before. Full of her\nown danger, she scarcely thought of her child till that was over; and\nthen she gave way to boisterous emotions.\n\nMary endeavoured to calm her at first, by sympathizing with her; and she\ntried to point out the only solid source of comfort but in doing this\nshe encountered many difficulties; she found her grossly ignorant, yet\nshe did not despair: and as the poor creature could not receive comfort\nfrom the operations of her own mind, she laboured to beguile the hours,\nwhich grief made heavy, by adapting her conversation to her capacity.\n\nThere are many minds that only receive impressions through the medium of\nthe senses: to them did Mary address herself; she made her some\npresents, and promised to assist her when they should arrive in England.\nThis employment roused her out of her late stupor, and again set the\nfaculties of her soul in motion; made the understanding contend with the\nimagination, and the heart throbbed not so irregularly during the\ncontention. How short-lived was the calm! when the English coast was\ndescried, her sorrows returned with redoubled vigor.--She was to visit\nand comfort the mother of her lost friend--And where then should she\ntake up her residence? These thoughts suspended the exertions of her\nunderstanding; abstracted reflections gave way to alarming\napprehensions; and tenderness undermined fortitude.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n\nIn England then landed the forlorn wanderer. She looked round for some\nfew moments--her affections were not attracted to any particular part of\nthe Island. She knew none of the inhabitants of the vast city to which\nshe was going: the mass of buildings appeared to her a huge body without\nan informing soul. As she passed through the streets in an\nhackney-coach, disgust and horror alternately filled her mind. She met\nsome women drunk; and the manners of those who attacked the sailors,\nmade her shrink into herself, and exclaim, are these my fellow\ncreatures!\n\nDetained by a number of carts near the water-side, for she came up the\nriver in the vessel, not having reason to hasten on shore, she saw\nvulgarity, dirt, and vice--her soul sickened; this was the first time\nsuch complicated misery obtruded itself on her sight.--Forgetting her\nown griefs, she gave the world a much indebted tear; mourned for a world\nin ruins. She then perceived, that great part of her comfort must arise\nfrom viewing the smiling face of nature, and be reflected from the view\nof innocent enjoyments: she was fond of seeing animals play, and could\nnot bear to see her own species sink below them.\n\nIn a little dwelling in one of the villages near London, lived the\nmother of Ann; two of her children still remained with her; but they did\nnot resemble Ann. To her house Mary directed the coach, and told the\nunfortunate mother of her loss. The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her\nmany other cares, after an inundation of tears, began to enumerate all\nher past misfortunes, and present cares. The heavy tale lasted until\nmidnight, and the impression it made on Mary's mind was so strong, that\nit banished sleep till towards morning; when tired nature sought\nforgetfulness, and the soul ceased to ruminate about many things.\n\nShe sent for the poor woman they took up at sea, provided her a lodging,\nand relieved her present necessities. A few days were spent in a kind of\nlistless way; then the mother of Ann began to enquire when she thought\nof returning home. She had hitherto treated her with the greatest\nrespect, and concealed her wonder at Mary's choosing a remote room in\nthe house near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as\nif she intended living in it.\n\nMary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n\nUnhappy, she wandered about the village, and relieved the poor; it was\nthe only employment that eased her aching heart; she became more\nintimate with misery--the misery that rises from poverty and the want of\neducation. She was in the vicinity of a great city; the vicious poor in\nand about it must ever grieve a benevolent contemplative mind.\n\nOne evening a man who stood weeping in a little lane, near the house she\nresided in, caught her eye. She accosted him; in a confused manner, he\ninformed her, that his wife was dying, and his children crying for the\nbread he could not earn. Mary desired to be conducted to his\nhabitation; it was not very distant, and was the upper room in an old\nmansion-house, which had been once the abode of luxury. Some tattered\nshreds of rich hangings still remained, covered with cobwebs and filth;\nround the ceiling, through which the rain drop'd, was a beautiful\ncornice mouldering; and a spacious gallery was rendered dark by the\nbroken windows being blocked up; through the apertures the wind forced\nits way in hollow sounds, and reverberated along the former scene of\nfestivity.\n\nIt was crowded with inhabitants: som were scolding, others swearing, or\nsinging indecent songs. What a sight for Mary! Her blood ran cold; yet\nshe had sufficient resolution to mount to the top of the house. On the\nfloor, in one corner of a very small room, lay an emaciated figure of a\nwoman; a window over her head scarcely admitted any light, for the\nbroken panes were stuffed with dirty rags. Near her were five children,\nall young, and covered with dirt; their sallow cheeks, and languid eyes,\nexhibited none of the charms of childhood. Some were fighting, and\nothers crying for food; their yells were mixed with their mother's\ngroans, and the wind which rushed through the passage. Mary was\npetrified; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and,\nregardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch,\nand breathed the most poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was\ndying of a putrid fever, the consequence of dirt and want.\n\nTheir state did not require much explanation. Mary sent the husband for\na poor neighbour, whom she hired to nurse the woman, and take care of\nthe children; and then went herself to buy them some necessaries at a\nshop not far distant. Her knowledge of physic had enabled her to\nprescribe for the woman; and she left the house, with a mixture of\nhorror and satisfaction.\n\nShe visited them every day, and procured them every comfort; contrary to\nher expectation, the woman began to recover; cleanliness and wholesome\nfood had a wonderful effect; and Mary saw her rising as it were from the\ngrave. Not aware of the danger she ran into, she did not think of it\ntill she perceived she had caught the fever. It made such an alarming\nprogress, that she was prevailed on to send for a physician; but the\ndisorder was so violent, that for some days it baffled his skill; and\nMary felt not her danger, as she was delirious. After the crisis, the\nsymptoms were more favourable, and she slowly recovered, without\nregaining much strength or spirits; indeed they were intolerably low:\nshe wanted a tender nurse.\n\nFor some time she had observed, that she was not treated with the same\nrespect as formerly; her favors were forgotten when no more were\nexpected. This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the\nwoman who came out of the ship. Mary had hitherto supported her; as her\nfinances were growing low, she hinted to her, that she ought to try to\nearn her own subsistence: the woman in return loaded her with abuse.\n\nTwo months were elapsed; she had not seen, or heard from Henry. He was\nsick--nay, perhaps had forgotten her; all the world was dreary, and all\nthe people ungrateful.\n\nShe sunk into apathy, and endeavouring to rouse herself out of it, she\nwrote in her book another fragment:\n\n\"Surely life is a dream, a frightful one! and after those rude,\ndisjointed images are fled, will light ever break in? Shall I ever feel\njoy? Do all suffer like me; or am I framed so as to be particularly\nsusceptible of misery? It is true, I have experienced the most rapturous\nemotions--short-lived delight!--ethereal beam, which only serves to shew\nmy present misery--yet lie still, my throbbing heart, or burst; and my\nbrain--why dost thou whirl about at such a terrifying rate? why do\nthoughts so rapidly rush into my mind, and yet when they disappear\nleave such deep traces? I could almost wish for the madman's happiness,\nand in a strong imagination lose a sense of woe.\n\n\"Oh! reason, thou boasted guide, why desert me, like the world, when I\nmost need thy assistance! Canst thou not calm this internal tumult, and\ndrive away the death-like sadness which presses so sorely on me,--a\nsadness surely very nearly allied to despair. I am now the prey of\napathy--I could wish for the former storms! a ray of hope sometimes\nillumined my path; I had a pursuit; but now _it visits not my haunts\nforlorn_. Too well have I loved my fellow creatures! I have been wounded\nby ingratitude; from every one it has something of the serpent's tooth.\n\n\"When overwhelmed by sorrow, I have met unkindness; I looked for some\none to have pity on me; but found none!--The healing balm of sympathy is\ndenied; I weep, a solitary wretch, and the hot tears scald my cheeks. I\nhave not the medicine of life, the dear chimera I have so often chased,\na friend. Shade of my loved Ann! dost thou ever visit thy poor Mary?\nRefined spirit, thou wouldst weep, could angels weep, to see her\nstruggling with passions she cannot subdue; and feelings which corrode\nher small portion of comfort!\"\n\nShe could not write any more; she wished herself far distant from all\nhuman society; a thick gloom spread itself over her mind: but did not\nmake her forget the very beings she wished to fly from. She sent for the\npoor woman she found in the garret; gave her money to clothe herself\nand children, and buy some furniture for a little hut, in a large\ngarden, the master of which agreed to employ her husband, who had been\nbred a gardener. Mary promised to visit the family, and see their new\nabode when she was able to go out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n\nMary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature\nbegan to look gay; with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a\nlittle robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his\nbest songs. The family were particularly civil this fine morning, and\ntried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness melted her;\nshe consented.\n\nSofter emotions banished her melancholy, and she directed her steps to\nthe habitation she had rendered comfortable.\n\nEmerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she\nhad last walked out, snow covered the ground, and bleak winds pierced\nher through and through: now the hedges were green, the blossoms adorned\nthe trees, and the birds sung. She reached the dwelling, without being\nmuch exhausted and while she rested there, observed the children\nsporting on the grass, with improved complexions. The mother with tears\nthanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. Mary's tears flowed\nnot only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections\nthe affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to\nplay, and reanimated nature. She observed the change in herself, tried\nto account for it, and wrote with her pencil a rhapsody on sensibility.\n\n\"Sensibility is the most exquisite feeling of which the human soul is\nsusceptible: when it pervades us, we feel happy; and could it last\nunmixed, we might form some conjecture of the bliss of those\nparadisiacal days, when the obedient passions were under the dominion of\nreason, and the impulses of the heart did not need correction.\n\n\"It is this quickness, this delicacy of feeling, which enables us to\nrelish the sublime touches of the poet, and the painter; it is this,\nwhich expands the soul, gives an enthusiastic greatness, mixed with\ntenderness, when we view the magnificent objects of nature; or hear of a\ngood action. The same effect we experience in the spring, when we hail\nthe returning sun, and the consequent renovation of nature; when the\nflowers unfold themselves, and exhale their sweets, and the voice of\nmusic is heard in the land. Softened by tenderness; the soul is\ndisposed to be virtuous. Is any sensual gratification to be compared to\nthat of feelings the eves moistened after having comforted the\nunfortunate?\n\n\"Sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these\nraptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by\nwhat strikes his gross senses; the delicate embellishments of nature\nescape his notice; as do the gentle and interesting affections.--But it\nis only to be felt; it escapes discussion.\"\n\nShe then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was\nrendered more cheerful by the presence of a man, past the meridian of\nlife, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He endeavoured to draw Mary\nout, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her\nartless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a\ncapacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination\nwas lively. She glanced from earth to heaven, and caught the light of\ntruth. Her expressive countenance shewed what passed in her mind, and\nher tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart; duplicity\nnever threw a shade over her words or actions. Mary found him a man of\nlearning; and the exercise of her understanding would frequently make\nher forget her griefs, when nothing else could, except benevolence.\n\nThis man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature\ninduced him to visit her; but when he saw Mary he had another\ninducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius, and cultivation\nof mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had such an\neffect on him, he was obliged to suppress it. He knew men, as well as\nbooks; his conversation was entertaining and improving. In Mary's\ncompany he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits masculine;\nand almost forgot that he had called the sex \"the pretty play things\nthat render life tolerable.\"\n\nHe had been the slave of beauty, the captive of sense; love he ne'er had\nfelt; the mind never rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made\nthe body appear lovely in his eyes. He was humane, despised meanness;\nbut was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of\nsociety. He talked often of the beauty of virtue; but not having any\nsolid foundation to build the practice on, he was only a shining, or\nrather a sparkling character: and though his fortune enabled him to\nhunt down pleasure, he was discontented.\n\nMary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections,\nwhich these observations led her to make; these reflections received a\ntinge from her mind; the present state of it, was that kind of painful\nquietness which arises from reason clouded by disgust; she had not yet\nlearned to be resigned; vague hopes agitated her.\n\n\"There are some subjects that are so enveloped in clouds, as you\ndissipate one, another overspreads it. Of this kind are our reasonings\nconcerning happiness; till we are obliged to cry out with the Apostle,\n_That it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive in what it\ncould consist_, or how satiety could be prevented. Man seems formed for\naction, though the passions are seldom properly managed; they are\neither so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent, as to\noverleap all bounds.\n\n\"Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape\nor other, visits every heart. Sensibility produces flights of virtue;\nand not curbed by reason, is on the brink of vice talking, and even\nthinking of virtue.\n\n\"Christianity can only afford just principles to govern the wayward\nfeelings and impulses of the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if\nnot transplanted into this soil; but how hard is it to keep the heart\ndiligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.\n\n\"It is very difficult to discipline the mind of a thinker, or reconcile\nhim to the weakness, the inconsistency of his understanding; and a\nstill more laborious task for him to conquer his passions, and learn to\nseek content, instead of happiness. Good dispositions, and virtuous\npropensities, without the light of the Gospel, produce eccentric\ncharacters: comet-like, they are always in extremes; while revelation\nresembles the laws of attraction, and produces uniformity; but too often\nis the attraction feeble; and the light so obscured by passion, as to\nforce the bewildered soul to fly into void space, and wander in\nconfusion.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n\nA few mornings after, as Mary was sitting ruminating, harassed by\nperplexing thoughts, and fears, a letter was delivered to her: the\nservant waited for an answer. Her heart palpitated; it was from Henry;\nshe held it some time in her hand, then tore it open; it was not a long\none; and only contained an account of a relapse, which prevented his\nsailing in the first packet, as he had intended. Some tender enquiries\nwere added, concerning her health, and state of mind; but they were\nexpressed in rather a formal style: it vexed her, and the more so, as it\nstopped the current of affection, which the account of his arrival and\nillness had made flow to her heart--it ceased to beat for a moment--she\nread the passage over again; but could not tell what she was hurt\nby--only that it did not answer the expectations of her affection. She\nwrote a laconic, incoherent note in return, allowing him to call on her\nthe next day--he had requested permission at the conclusion of his\nletter.\n\nHer mind was then painfully active; she could not read or walk; she\ntried to fly from herself, to forget the long hours that were yet to run\nbefore to-morrow could arrive: she knew not what time he would come;\ncertainly in the morning, she concluded; the morning then was anxiously\nwished for; and every wish produced a sigh, that arose from expectation\non the stretch, damped by fear and vain regret.\n\nTo beguile the tedious time, Henry's favorite tunes were sung; the books\nthey read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a\nhundred times.--Any one who had seen her, would have supposed that she\nwas trying to decypher Chinese characters.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, she hailed the tardy day, watched the rising\nsun, and then listened for every footstep, and started if she heard the\nstreet door opened. At last he came, and she who had been counting the\nhours, and doubting whether the earth moved, would gladly have escaped\nthe approaching interview.\n\nWith an unequal, irresolute pace, she went to meet him; but when she\nbeheld his emaciated countenance, all the tenderness, which the\nformality of his letter had damped, returned, and a mournful\npresentiment stilled the internal conflict. She caught his hand, and\nlooking wistfully at him, exclaimed, \"Indeed, you are not well!\"\n\n\"I am very far from well; but it matters not,\" added he with a smile of\nresignation; \"my native air may work wonders, and besides, my mother is\na tender nurse, and I shall sometimes see thee.\"\n\nMary felt for the first time in her life, envy; she wished\ninvoluntarily, that all the comfort he received should be from her. She\nenquired about the symptoms of his disorder; and heard that he had been\nvery ill; she hastily drove away the fears, that former dear bought\nexperience suggested: and again and again did she repeat, that she was\nsure he would soon recover. She would then look in his face, to see if\nhe assented, and ask more questions to the same purport. She tried to\navoid speaking of herself, and Henry left her, with, a promise of\nvisiting her the next day.\n\nHer mind was now engrossed by one fear--yet she would not allow herself\nto think that she feared an event she could not name. She still saw his\npale face; the sound of his voice still vibrated on her ears; she tried\nto retain it; she listened, looked round, wept, and prayed.\n\nHenry had enlightened the desolate scene: was this charm of life to fade\naway, and, like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wreck\nbehind? These thoughts disturbed her reason, she shook her head, as if\nto drive them out of it; a weight, a heavy one, was on her heart; all\nwas not well there.\n\nOut of this reverie she was soon woke to keener anguish, by the arrival\nof a letter from her husband; it came to Lisbon after her departure:\nHenry had forwarded it to her, but did not choose to deliver it\nhimself, for a very obvious reason; it might have produced a\nconversation he wished for some time to avoid; and his precaution took\nits rise almost equally from benevolence and love.\n\nShe could not muster up sufficient resolution to break the seal: her\nfears were not prophetic, for the contents gave her comfort. He informed\nher that he intended prolonging his tour, as he was now his own master,\nand wished to remain some time on the continent, and in particular to\nvisit Italy without any restraint: but his reasons for it appeared\nchildish; it was not to cultivate his taste, or tread on classic ground,\nwhere poets and philosophers caught their lore; but to join in the\nmasquerades, and such burlesque amusements.\n\nThese instances of folly relieved Mary, in some degree reconciled her\nto herself added fuel to the devouring flame--and silenced something\nlike a pang, which reason and conscience made her feel, when she\nreflected, that it is the office of Religion to reconcile us to the\nseemingly hard dispensations of providence; and that no inclination,\nhowever strong, should oblige us to desert the post assigned us, or\nforce us to forget that virtue should be an active principle; and that\nthe most desirable station, is the one that exercises our faculties,\nrefines our affections, and enables us to be useful.\n\nOne reflection continually wounded her repose; she feared not poverty;\nher wants were few; but in giving up a fortune, she gave up the power of\ncomforting the miserable, and making the sad heart sing for joy.\n\nHeaven had endowed her with uncommon humanity, to render her one of His\nbenevolent agents, a messenger of peace; and should she attend to her\nown inclinations?\n\nThese suggestions, though they could not subdue a violent passion,\nincreased her misery. One moment she was a heroine, half determined to\nbear whatever fate should inflict; the next, her mind would recoil--and\ntenderness possessed her whole soul. Some instances of Henry's\naffection, his worth and genius, were remembered: and the earth was only\na vale of tears, because he was not to sojourn with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n\nHenry came the next day, and once or twice in the course of the\nfollowing week; but still Mary kept up some little formality, a certain\nconsciousness restrained her; and Henry did not enter on the subject\nwhich he found she wished to avoid. In the course of conversation,\nhowever, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a\nplace in one of the public offices for Ann's brother, as the family were\nagain in a declining way.\n\nHenry attended, made a few enquiries, and dropped the subject; but the\nfollowing week, she heard him enter with unusual haste; it was to inform\nher, that he had made interest with a person of some consequence, whom\nhe had once obliged in a very disagreeable exigency, in a foreign\ncountry; and that he had procured a place for her friend, which would\ninfallibly lead to something better, if he behaved with propriety. Mary\ncould not speak to thank him; emotions of gratitude and love suffused\nher face; her blood eloquently spoke. She delighted to receive benefits\nthrough the medium of her fellow creatures; but to receive them from\nHenry was exquisite pleasure.\n\nAs the summer advanced, Henry grew worse; the closeness of the air, in\nthe metropolis, affected his breath; and his mother insisted on his\nfixing on some place in the country, where she would accompany him. He\ncould not think of going far off, but chose a little village on the\nbanks of the Thames, near Mary's dwelling: he then introduced her to his\nmother.\n\nThey frequently went down the river in a boat; Henry would take his\nviolin, and Mary would sometimes sing, or read, to them. She pleased his\nmother; she inchanted him. It was an advantage to Mary that friendship\nfirst possessed her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of\nhumanity:--and when this first affection was torn away, a similar one\nsprung up, with a still tenderer sentiment added to it.\n\nThe last evening they were on the water, the clouds grew suddenly black,\nand broke in violent showers, which interrupted the solemn stillness\nthat had prevailed previous to it. The thunder roared; and the oars\nplying quickly, in order to reach the shore, occasioned a not\nunpleasing sound. Mary drew still nearer Henry; she wished to have\nsought with him a watry grave; to have escaped the horror of surviving\nhim.--She spoke not, but Henry saw the workings of her mind--he felt\nthem; threw his arm round her waist--and they enjoyed the luxury of\nwretchedness.--As they touched the shore, Mary perceived that Henry was\nwet; with eager anxiety she cried, What shall I do!--this day will kill\nthee, and I shall not die with thee!\n\nThis accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured\nhim, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject to--perhaps it\nwas not the cold that he caught, that occasioned it. In vain did Mary\ntry to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her! Henry every day grew worse\nand worse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n\nOppressed by her foreboding fears, her sore mind was hurt by new\ninstances of ingratitude: disgusted with the family, whose misfortunes\nhad often disturbed her repose, and lost in anticipated sorrow, she\nrambled she knew not where; when turning down a shady walk, she\ndiscovered her feet had taken the path they delighted to tread. She saw\nHenry sitting in his garden alone; he quickly opened the garden-gate,\nand she sat down by him.\n\n\"I did not,\" said he, \"expect to see thee this evening, my dearest Mary;\nbut I was thinking of thee. Heaven has endowed thee with an uncommon\nportion of fortitude, to support one of the most affectionate hearts in\nthe world. This is not a time for disguise; I know I am dear to\nthee--and my affection for thee is twisted with every fibre of my\nheart.--I loved thee ever since I have been acquainted with thine: thou\nart the being my fancy has delighted to form; but which I imagined\nexisted only there! In a little while the shades of death will encompass\nme--ill-fated love perhaps added strength to my disease, and smoothed\nthe rugged path. Try, my love, to fulfil thy destined course--try to add\nto thy other virtues patience. I could have wished, for thy sake, that\nwe could have died together--or that I could live to shield thee from\nthe assaults of an unfeeling world! Could I but offer thee an asylum in\nthese arms--a faithful bosom, in which thou couldst repose all thy\ngriefs--\" He pressed her to it, and she returned the pressure--he felt her\nthrobbing heart. A mournful silence ensued! when he resumed the\nconversation. \"I wished to prepare thee for the blow--too surely do I\nfeel that it will not be long delayed! The passion I have nursed is so\npure, that death cannot extinguish it--or tear away the impression thy\nvirtues have made on my soul. I would fain comfort thee--\"\n\n\"Talk not of comfort,\" interrupted Mary, \"it will be in heaven with thee\nand Ann--while I shall remain on earth the veriest wretch!\"--She grasped\nhis hand.\n\n\"There we shall meet, my love, my Mary, in our Father's--\" His voice\nfaultered; he could not finish the sentence; he was almost\nsuffocated--they both wept, their tears relieved them; they walked\nslowly to the garden-gate (Mary would not go into the house); they could\nnot say farewel when they reached it--and Mary hurried down the lane; to\nspare Henry the pain of witnessing her emotions.\n\nWhen she lost sight of the house she sat down on the ground, till it\ngrew late, thinking of all that had passed. Full of these thoughts, she\ncrept along, regardless of the descending rain; when lifting up her eyes\nto heaven, and then turning them wildly on the prospects around, without\nmarking them; she only felt that the scene accorded with her present\nstate of mind. It was the last glimmering of twilight, with a full moon,\nover which clouds continually flitted. Where am I wandering, God of\nMercy! she thought; she alluded to the wanderings of her mind. In what a\nlabyrinth am I lost! What miseries have I already encountered--and what\na number lie still before me.\n\nHer thoughts flew rapidly to something. I could be happy listening to\nhim, soothing his cares.--Would he not smile upon me--call me his own\nMary? I am not his--said she with fierceness--I am a wretch! and she\nheaved a sigh that almost broke her heart, while the big tears rolled\ndown her burning cheeks; but still her exercised mind, accustomed to\nthink, began to observe its operation, though the barrier of reason was\nalmost carried away, and all the faculties not restrained by her, were\nrunning into confusion. Wherefore am I made thus? Vain are my\nefforts--I cannot live without loving--and love leads to madness.--Yet\nI will not weep; and her eyes were now fixed by despair, dry and\nmotionless; and then quickly whirled about with a look of distraction.\n\nShe looked for hope; but found none--all was troubled waters.--No where\ncould she find rest. I have already paced to and fro in the earth; it is\nnot my abiding place--may I not too go home! Ah! no. Is this complying\nwith my Henry's request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to\nassociate with his? Tears of tenderness strayed down her relaxed\ncountenance, and her softened heart heaved more regularly. She felt the\nrain, and turned to her solitary home.\n\nFatigued by the tumultuous emotions she had endured, when she entered\nthe house she ran to her own room, sunk on the bed; and exhausted\nnature soon closed her eyes; but active fancy was still awake, and a\nthousand fearful dreams interrupted her slumbers.\n\nFeverish and languid, she opened her eyes, and saw the unwelcome sun\ndart his rays through a window, the curtains of which she had forgotten\nto draw. The dew hung on the adjacent trees, and added to the lustre;\nthe little robin began his song, and distant birds joined. She looked;\nher countenance was still vacant--her sensibility was absorbed by one\nobject.\n\nDid I ever admire the rising sun, she slightly thought, turning from the\nWindow, and shutting her eyes: she recalled to view the last night's\nscene. His faltering voice, lingering step, and the look of tender woe,\nwere all graven on her heart; as were the words \"Could these arms\nshield thee from sorrow--afford thee an asylum from an unfeeling world.\"\nThe pressure to his bosom was not forgot. For a moment she was happy;\nbut in a long-drawn sigh every delightful sensation evaporated.\nSoon--yes, very soon, will the grave again receive all I love! and the\nremnant of my days--she could not proceed--Were there then days to come\nafter that?\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n\nJust as she was going to quit her room, to visit Henry, his mother\ncalled on her.\n\n\"My son is worse to-day,\" said she, \"I come to request you to spend not\nonly this day, but a week or two with me.--Why should I conceal any\nthing from you? Last night my child made his mother his confident, and,\nin the anguish of his heart, requested me to be thy friend--when I shall\nbe childless. I will not attempt to describe what I felt when he talked\nthus to me. If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a\nwidow--may I call her Child whom my Henry wishes me to adopt?\"\n\nThis new instance of Henry's disinterested affection, Mary felt most\nforcibly; and striving to restrain the complicated emotions, and sooth\nthe wretched mother, she almost fainted: when the unhappy parent forced\ntears from her, by saying, \"I deserve this blow; my partial fondness\nmade me neglect him, when most he wanted a mother's care; this neglect,\nperhaps, first injured his constitution: righteous Heaven has made my\ncrime its own punishment; and now I am indeed a mother, I shall loss my\nchild--my only child!\"\n\nWhen they were a little more composed they hastened to the invalide; but\nduring the short ride, the mother related several instances of Henry's\ngoodness of heart. Mary's tears were not those of unmixed anguish; the\ndisplay of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature\nprevailed; she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a\nmore genial clime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n\nShe found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before declared\nhe never knew a person with a similar pulse recover. Henry was certain\nhe could not live long; all the rest he could obtain, was procured by\nopiates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and\nsoftened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh\ndid she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She\nwould boast of her resignation--yet catch eagerly at the least ray of\nhope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her head\nwhere she could feel his breath. She loved him better than herself--she\ncould not pray for his recovery; she could only say, The will of Heaven\nbe done.\n\nWhile she was in this state, she labored to acquire fortitude; but one\ntender look destroyed it all--she rather labored, indeed, to make him\nbelieve he was resigned, than really to be so.\n\nShe wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which\nwas to extend beyond the grave. She did so, and received comfort from\nit; she rose above her misery.\n\nHis end was now approaching. Mary sat on the side of the bed. His eyes\nappeared fixed--no longer agitated by passion, he only felt that it was\na fearful thing to die. The soul retired to the citadel; but it was not\nnow solely filled by the image of her who in silent despair watched for\nhis last breath. Collected, a frightful calmness stilled every turbulent\nemotion.\n\nThe mother's grief was more audible. Henry had for some time only\nattended to Mary--Mary pitied the parent, whose stings of conscience\nincreased her sorrow; she whispered him, \"Thy mother weeps, disregarded\nby thee; oh! comfort her!--My mother, thy son blesses thee.--\" The\noppressed parent left the room. And Mary _waited_ to see him die.\n\nShe pressed with trembling eagerness his parched lips--he opened his\neyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them--he gave\na look--it was never forgotten. My Mary, will you be comforted?\n\nYes, yes, she exclaimed in a firm voice; you go to be happy--I am not a\ncomplete wretch! The words almost choked her.\n\nHe was a long time silent; the opiate produced a kind of stupor. At\nlast, in an agony, he cried, It is dark; I cannot see thee; raise me up.\nWhere is Mary? did she not say she delighted to support me? let me die\nin her arms.\n\nHer arms were opened to receive him; they trembled not. Again he was\nobliged to lie down, resting on her: as the agonies increased he leaned\ntowards her: the soul seemed flying to her, as it escaped out of its\nprison. The breathing was interrupted; she heard distinctly the last\nsigh--and lifting up to Heaven her eyes, Father, receive his spirit, she\ncalmly cried.\n\nThe attendants gathered round; she moved not, nor heard the clamor; the\nhand seemed yet to press hers; it still was warm. A ray of light from\nan opened window discovered the pale face.\n\nShe left the room, and retired to one very near it; and sitting down on\nthe floor, fixed her eyes on the door of the apartment which contained\nthe body. Every event of her life rushed across her mind with wonderful\nrapidity--yet all was still--fate had given the finishing stroke. She\nsat till midnight.--Then rose in a phrensy, went into the apartment, and\ndesired those who watched the body to retire.\n\nShe knelt by the bed side;--an enthusiastic devotion overcame the\ndictates of despair.--She prayed most ardently to be supported, and\ndedicated herself to the service of that Being into whose hands, she had\ncommitted the spirit she almost adored--again--and again,--she prayed\nwildly--and fervently--but attempting to touch the lifeless hand--her\nhead swum--she sunk--\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n\nThree months after, her only friend, the mother of her lost Henry began\nto be alarmed, at observing her altered appearance; and made her own\nhealth a pretext for travelling. These complaints roused Mary out of her\ntorpid state; she imagined a new duty now forced her to exert herself--a\nduty love made sacred!--\n\nThey went to Bath, from that to Bristol; but the latter place they\nquickly left; the sight of the sick that resort there, they neither of\nthem could bear. From Bristol they flew to Southampton. The road was\npleasant--yet Mary shut her eyes;--or if they were open, green fields\nand commons, passed in quick succession, and left no more traces behind\nthan if they had been waves of the sea.\n\nSome time after they were settled at Southampton, they met the man who\ntook so much notice of Mary, soon after her return to England. He\nrenewed his acquaintance; he was really interested in her fate, as he\nhad heard her uncommon story; besides, he knew her husband; knew him to\nbe a good-natured, weak man. He saw him soon after his arrival in his\nnative country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons\nof Mary's strange conduct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if\nhe ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure. He was guided by him,\nand allowed him to follow Mary to Southampton, and speak first to her\nfriend.\n\nThis friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and\ninformed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: Mary was not\nable, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of\nconduct she ought now to pursue. But at last she conquered her disgust,\nand wrote her _husband_ an account of what had passed since she had\ndropped his correspondence.\n\nHe came in person to answer the letter. Mary fainted when he approached\nher unexpectedly. Her disgust returned with additional force, in spite\nof previous reasonings, whenever he appeared; yet she was prevailed on\nto promise to live with him, if he would permit her to pass one year,\ntravelling from place to place; he was not to accompany her.\n\nThe time too quickly elapsed, and she gave him her hand--the struggle\nwas almost more than she could endure. She tried to appear calm; time\nmellowed her grief, and mitigated her torments; but when her husband\nwould take her hand, or mention any thing like love, she would instantly\nfeel a sickness, a faintness at her heart, and wish, involuntarily, that\nthe earth would open and swallow her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n\nMary visited the continent, and sought health in different climates; but\nher nerves were not to be restored to their former state. She then\nretired to her house in the country, established manufactories, threw\nthe estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way\nto dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret. She visited the sick,\nsupported the old, and educated the young.\n\nThese occupations engrossed her mind; but there were hours when all her\nformer woes would return and haunt her.--Whenever she did, or said, any\nthing she thought Henry would have approved of--she could not avoid\nthinking with anguish, of the rapture his approbation ever conveyed to\nher heart--a heart in which there was a void, that even benevolence and\nreligion could not fill. The latter taught her to struggle for\nresignation; and the former rendered life supportable.\n\nHer delicate state of health did not promise long life. In moments of\nsolitary sadness, a gleam of joy would dart across her mind--She thought\nshe was hastening to that world _where there is neither marrying_, nor\ngiving in marriage.", "answers": ["Because she is in unrequited love with someone else"], "length": 23316, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "26c6325283dece0b557e34cde9a5c57999ec5c68782e8194"}
{"input": "With whom does the entertainers' manager have an affair?", "context": "The Seventh Seal\n<b> \n</b>The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of\nwind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies\nprostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are \nwide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep. \n\nNearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he \ncollapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His \nopen mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.\nAt the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles \ntowards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.\n\nThe KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his \nsunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the \ndarkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on \nhis head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning \nagainst the grime. \n\nThe KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed \nand brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched \ntogether and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He \nopens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from \nthe misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a \ndome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, \nbarely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and \nrestless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius \nBlock turns around.\n\nBehind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his \nhands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWho are you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI am Death.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHave you come for me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have been walking by your side for a long \n\t\ttime. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat I know. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAre you prepared?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tMy body is frightened, but I am not. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWell, there is no shame in that.\n\nThe KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place \nit around the KNIGHT'S shoulders. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWait a moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThat's what they all say. I grant no reprieves. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou play chess, don't you?\n\nA gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHow did you know that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have seen it in paintings and heard it sung \n\t\tin ballads.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut you can't be better than I am.\n\nThe KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes \nout a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins \nsetting up the pieces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhy do you want to play chess with me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have my reasons. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThat is your privilege.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe condition is that I may live as long as I \n\t\thold out against you. If I win, you will \n\t\trelease me. Is it agreed? \n\nThe KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. \nDEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou drew black!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tVery appropriate. Don't you think so?\n\nThe KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, \nAntonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's \npawn.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has \nceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow \nwhitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day \nis already scorchingly hot.\n\nThe squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he \ngrunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his \nhorse and picks up the heavy pack.\n\nThe KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and \nup towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his \nsquire. JONS soon overtakes him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t \tBetween a strumpet's legs to lie \n\t\tIs the life for which I sigh.\n\nHe stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn't heard JON'S song, or \nhe pretends that he hasn't. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS \nsings even louder. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tUp above is God Almighty \n\t\tSo very far away, \n\t\tBut your brother the Devil \n\t\tYou will meet on every level.\n\nJONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his \nhorse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The \nlong, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They \nride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the \nsea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIn Frjestad everyone was talking about evil \n\t\tomens and other horrible things. Two horses had \n\t\teaten each other in the night, and, in the \n\t\tchurchyard, graves had been opened and the \n\t\tremains of corpses scattered all over the \n\t\tplace. Yesterday afternoon there were as many \n\t\tas four suns in the heavens.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT doesn't answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling \ntowards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot \nsun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The \nmiserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, \nwagging its tail.\n\nJONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. \nWhen he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake \nhim awake. He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back \nhis hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. \nIt is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth. \n\nJONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin \nand hands the bag to the knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWell, did he show you the way? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNot exactly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat did he say? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNothing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWas he a mute?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of \n\t\tfact, he was quite eloquent. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tHe was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that \n\t\twhat he had to say was most depressing.\n\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tOne moment you're bright and lively, \n\t\tThe next you're crawling with worms. \n\t\tFate is a terrible villain \n\t\tAnd you, my friend, its poor victim. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMust you sing? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\nThe KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a \nwhile. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle \ndown their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They \nride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees \nstands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby \nand is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest \nunder the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the \nbend of the road.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nIn his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer \nfrom a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the \nwagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light \nacross the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who \nare sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, \nsnores loudly. \n\nJOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big \ntrees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny \nold horse. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGood morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't \n\t\teat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? \n\t\tWe're a little hard up. People aren't very \n\t\tinterested in juggling in this part of the \n\t\tcountry.\n\nHe has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he \nstands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down \nwith a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to \nsway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and \nthe grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long \nwarble.\n\nJOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed \nexpression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and \nbees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.\n\nSuddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, \nthe flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around \ngrazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies. \n\nJOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen \n\t\tsomething. I've got to tell you about it!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(sits up, terrified)\n\t\tWhat is it? What's happened? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tListen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a \n\t\tvision. It was real, absolutely real.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOh, so you've had a vision again!\n\nMIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by \nthe shoulders. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tBut I did see her! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhom did you see? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe Virgin Mary.\n\nMIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDid you really see her?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tShe was so close to me that I could have \n\t\ttouched her. She had a golden crown on her head \n\t\tand wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She \n\t\twas barefoot and had small brown hands with \n\t\twhich she was holding the Child and teaching \n\t\tHim to walk. And then she saw me watching her \n\t\tand she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears \n\t\tand when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. \n\t\tAnd everything became so still in the sky and \n\t\ton the earth. Can you understand ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat an imagination you have.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYou don't believe me! But it was real, I tell \n\t\tyou, not the kind of reality you see every day, \n\t\tbut a different kind. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tPerhaps it was the kind of reality you told us \n\t\tabout when you saw the Devil painting our wagon \n\t\twheels red, using his tail as a brush.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tWhy must you keep bringing that up? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tAnd then you discovered that you had red paint \n\t\tunder your nails.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWell, perhaps that time I made it up. \n\t\t\t(eagerly)  \n\t\tI did it just so that you would believe in my \n\t\tother visions. The real ones. The ones that I \n\t\tdidn't make up. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(severely)\n\t\tYou have to keep your visions under control.\n\t\tOtherwise people will think that you're a \n\t\thalf-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- \n\t\tas far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm \n\t\tnot so sure about that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tI didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it \n\t\tif voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin \n\t\tappears before me and angels and devils like my \n\t\tcompany.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(sits up)\n\t\tHaven't I told you once and for all that I need \n\t\tmy morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, \n\t\tpleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm \n\t\ttelling you to shut up!\n\nHis eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he \nleft off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They \nsit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms \nvigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed \nand astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIf we would only get some rain. Everything is \n\t\tburned to cinders. We won't have anything to \n\t\teat this winter. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(yawning)\n\t\tWe'll get by.\n\nHe says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs \ncontentedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI want Mikael to have a better life than ours. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or \n\t\ta juggler who can do the one impossible trick. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat's that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tTo make one of the balls stand absolutely still\n\t\tin the air. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tBut that's impossible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tImpossible for us -- but not for him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou're dreaming again.\n\nShe yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.\nJOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI've composed a song. I made it up during the \n\t\tnight when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to \n\t\thear it? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tSing it. I'm very curious.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have to sit up first.\n\nHe sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and \nsings in a loud voice. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tOn a lily branch a dove is perched \n\t\tAgainst the summer sky, \n\t\tShe sings a wondrous song of Christ \n\t\tAnd there's great joy on high.\n\nHe interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia! Are you asleep? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt's a lovely song. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI haven't finished yet.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little \n\t\tlonger. You can sing the rest to me afterwards. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAll you do is sleep.\n\nJOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also \nsleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He \nyawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely \nmade death mask.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tIs this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If \n\t\tthe priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no \n\t\tthank you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAre you going to play Death?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tJust think, scaring decent folk out of their \n\t\twits with this kind of nonsense.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhen are we supposed to do this play?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tAt the saints' feast in Elsinore.

There's a rumor going around that \n\t\tthere's a terrible pestilence in the land, and \n\t\tnow the priests are prophesying sudden death \n\t\tand all sorts of spiritual agonies. \n\nMIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of \ngrass and looking smilingly at her husband.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd what part am I to play?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYou're such a damn fool, so you're going to be \n\t\tthe Soul of Man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThat's a bad part, of course.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tWho makes the decisions around here?

Your life hangs by \n\t\ta thread. Your time is short. \n\t\t\t(in his usual voice) \n\t\tAre the women going to like me in this getup? \n\t\tWill I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead \n\t\talready.\n\nHe stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. \nMIA lies beside him on the grass. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tJof!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhat is it?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tSit still.

I love you.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nWaves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The \nKNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows \nhim in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the \nright of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite \nfinished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and \npaint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in \nhis hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other \nfaces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat is this supposed to represent? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe Dance of Death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd that one is Death?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYes, he dances off with all of them.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy do you paint such nonsense?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI thought it would serve to remind people that \n\t\tthey must die.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWell, it's not going to make them feel any \n\t\thappier. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tWhy should one always make people happy? It \n\t\tmight not be a bad idea to scare them a little \n\t\tonce in a while.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThen they'll close their eyes and refuse to \n\t\tlook at your painting.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tOh, they'll look. A skull is almost more \n\t\tinteresting than a naked woman.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf you do scare them ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThey'll think. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd if they think ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThey'll become still more scared.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd then they'll run right into the arms of the \n\t\tpriests. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThat's not my business.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou're only painting your Dance of Death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI'm only painting things as they are. Everyone \n\t\telse can do as he likes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tJust think how some people will curse you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tMaybe. But then I'll paint something amusing \n\t\tfor them to look at. I have to make a living \n\t\t-- at least until the plague takes me.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThe plague. That sounds horrible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYou should see the boils on a diseased man's \n\t\tthroat. You should see how his body shrivels up \n\t\tso that his legs look like knotted strings -- \n\t\tlike the man I've painted over there.\n\nThe PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in \nthe grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat looks terrible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tIt certainly does. He tries to rip out the \n\t\tboil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open \n\t\twith his fingernails and his screams can be \n\t\theard everywhere. Does that scare you?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tScare? Me? You don't know me. What are the \n\t\thorrors you've painted over there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe remarkable thing is that the poor creatures\n\t\tthink the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. \n\t\tMobs of people who call themselves Slaves of \n\t\tSin are swarming over the country, flagellating \n\t\tthemselves and others, all for the glory of God.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo they really whip themselves?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tYes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a \n\t\tditch and hide when they pass by.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you have any brandy? I've been drinking \n\t\twater all day and it's made me as thirsty as a \n\t\tcamel in the desert. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tI think I frightened you after all.\n\nJONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.\n\n\n\nThe KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.\nThe air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony \neyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of \nanguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil \nspying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the \nconfession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the \ngrille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want to talk to you as openly as I can, but \n\t\tmy heart is empty.\n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe emptiness is a mirror turned towards my \n\t\town face. I see myself in it, and I am filled \n\t\twith fear and disgust. \n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThrough my indifference to my fellow men, I \n\t\thave isolated myself from their company. Now I \n\t\tlive in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in \n\t\tmy dreams and fantasies. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAnd yet you don't want to die. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I do.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhat are you waiting for? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want knowledge. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou want guarantees?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tCall it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly \n\t\tinconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why \n\t\tshould He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken \n\t\tpromises and unseen miracles? \n\nDEATH doesn't answer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow can we have faith in those who believe when \n\t\twe can't have faith in ourselves? What is going \n\t\tto happen to those of us who want to believe \n\t\tbut aren't able to? And what is to become of \n\t\tthose who neither want to nor are capable of \n\t\tbelieving?\n\nThe KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. \nThere is complete silence. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy can't I kill God within me? Why does He \n\t\tlive on in this painful and humiliating way \n\t\teven though I curse Him and want to tear Him \n\t\tout of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, \n\t\tis He a baffling reality that I can't shake \n\t\toff? Do you hear me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYes, I hear you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, \n\t\tbut knowledge. I want God to stretch out His \n\t\thand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to \n\t\tme. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tBut He remains silent.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tI call out to Him in the dark but no one seems \n\t\tto be there.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tPerhaps no one is there.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThen life is an outrageous horror. No one can \n\t\tlive in the face of death, knowing that all is \n\t\tnothingness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tMost people never reflect about either death or \n\t\tthe futility of life.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tBut one day they will have to stand at that \n\t\tlast moment of life and look towards the \n\t\tdarkness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhen that day comes ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIn our fear, we make an image, and that image \n\t\twe call God.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou are worrying ...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDeath visited me this morning. We are playing \n\t\tchess together. This reprieve gives me the \n\t\tchance to arrange an urgent matter.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhat matter is that?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMy life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, \n\t\ta great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no \n\t\tbitterness or self-reproach because the lives \n\t\tof most people are very much like this. But I \n\t\twill use my reprieve for one meaningful deed. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIs that why you are playing chess with Death? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHe is a clever opponent, but up to now I \n\t\thaven't lost a single man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHow will you outwit Death in your game? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI use a combination of the bishop and the \n\t\tknight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the \n\t\tnext move I'll shatter one of his flanks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'll remember that.\n\nDEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but \ndisappears instantly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet \n\t\tagain, and I'll find a way.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\t\t(invisible)\n\t\tWe'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue \n\t\tplaying.\n\nThe KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes \nthrough the tiny window. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThis is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood \n\t\tpulsing through it. The sun is still high in \n\t\tthe sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing \n\t\tchess with Death. \n\nHe makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly \ntogether.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMe and my master have been abroad and have just \n\t\tcome home. Do you understand, you little \n\t\tpictor? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe Crusade.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tPrecisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy \n\t\tLand and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, \n\t\twild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the \n\t\twine poison us, the women give us lice, the \n\t\tlice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the \n\t\tGlory of God. Our crusade was such madness that \n\t\tonly a real idealist could have thought it up. \n\t\tBut what you said about the plague was \n\t\thorrible. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tIt's worse than that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAh, me. No matter which way you turn, you have \n\t\tyour rump behind you. That's the truth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAINTER \n</b>\t\tThe rump behind you, the rump behind you \n\t\tthere's a profound truth.\n\nJONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThis is squire Jns. He grins at Death, mocks \n\t\tthe Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the \n\t\tgirls. His world is a Jnsworld, believable \n\t\tonly to himself, ridiculous to all including \n\t\thimself, meaningless to Heaven and of no \n\t\tinterest to Hell. \n\nThe KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright \nsunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.\n\nOutside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a \nwoman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been \nshaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet \nshe doesn't appear to be fully conscious. \n\nJONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working \nquickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk \nmumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and \nwith his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and \naround the woman. JONS holds his nose.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What \n\t\tis it good for?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tShe has had carnal intercourse with the Evil \n\t\tOne. \n\nHe whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky \nmess on the wall. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAnd now she's in the stocks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tShe will be burned tomorrow morning at the \n\t\tparish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil \n\t\taway from the rest of us.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(holding his nose)\n\t\tAnd you do that with this stinking mess?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tIt's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile \n\t\tof a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the \n\t\tsmell. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNeither can I.\n<b> \n</b>JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments \nlooking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes \ntowards him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHave you seen the Devil?\n\nThe MONK stops reading and raises his head. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK \n</b>\t\tYou must not talk to her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tCan that be so dangerous?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK \n</b>\t\tI don't know, but she is believed to have \n\t\tcaused the pestilence with which we are \n\t\taffected. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI understand.\n\nHe nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though \nshe were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two \nriders for a considerable distance down the road.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is \nempty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.\n\nThey approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS \nties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the \npath towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and \nalmost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when \nno one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft \nobject. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying \nwith her face to the ground.\n\nAt the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man \ncomes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are \nblack and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and \nin rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner \nroom, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the \nwalls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his \nbag.\n\nSlowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully \nslips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the \ndoor. She stops and stares at the stranger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tWhy do you look so surprised? I steal from the \n\t\tdead. These days it's quite a lucrative \n\t\tenterprise. \n\nThe GIRL makes a movement as if to run away. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tYou're thinking of running to the village and \n\t\ttelling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each \n\t\tof us has to save his own skin. It's as simple \n\t\tas that. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\t\tDon't touch me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDon't try to scream. There's no one around to \n\t\thear you, neither God nor man.\n\nSlowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost \ntotal darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI recognize you, although it's a long time \n\t\tsince we met. Your name is Raval, from the \n\t\ttheological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. \n\t\tMirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis. \n\nRAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAm I not right?\n\nThe GIRL stands immobile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou were the one who, ten years ago, convinced \n\t\tmy master of the necessity to join a better-\n\t\tclass crusade to the Holy Land.\n\nRAVAL looks around.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-\n\t\tache? \n\nRAVAL smiles anxiously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhen I see you, I suddenly understand the \n\t\tmeaning of these ten years, which previously \n\t\tseemed to me such a waste. Our life was too \n\t\tgood and we were too satisfied with ourselves. \n\t\tThe Lord wanted to punish us for our \n\t\tcomplacency. That is why He sent you to spew \n\t\tout your holy venom and poison the knight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI acted in good faith.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBut now you know better, don't you? Because \n\t\tnow you have turned into a thief. A more \n\t\tfitting and rewarding occupation for \n\t\tscoundrels. Isn't that so?\n\nWith a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL'S hand, gives him a \nkick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly \nthe GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBy all means. I'm not bloodthirsty. \n\nHe bends over RAVAL. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tDon't beat me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. \n\t\tBut remember this: the next time we meet, I'll \n\t\tbrand your face the way one does with thieves. \n\t\t\t(he rises)\n\t\tWhat I really came for is to get my waterskin \n\t\tfilled.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL \n</b>\t\tWe have a deep well with cool, fresh water. \n\t\tCome, I'll show you.\n\nThey walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises \nslowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals \naway. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps \nhim.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tJns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative \n\t\tyoung man who has never had anything but kind \n\t\tthoughts and has only done beautiful and noble \n\t\tdeeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With \n\t\tthem, there is no limit to my kindness. \n\nHe embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost \nimmediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats \nthe GIRL on the cheek.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tGoodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped \n\t\tyou, but between you and me, I'm tired of that \n\t\tkind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.\n\nHe laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance \nhe turns; the GIRL is still there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNow that I think of it, I will need a \n\t\thousekeeper. Can you prepare good food? \n\t\t\t(the GIRL nods)\n\t\tAs far as I know, I'm still a married man, but\n\t\tI have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.\n\t\tThat's why I need a housekeeper. \n\t\t\t(the GIRL doesn't \n\t\t\tanswer but gets up)\n\t\tThe devil with it! Come along and don't stand \n\t\tthere staring. I've saved your life, so you owe \n\t\tme a great deal.\n\nShe begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn't wait for her but \nwalks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague \nhas not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.\n\nThe actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. \nDressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.\n\nThe spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are\nmerchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands \nand milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink \nbeer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps \nat JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay \nand lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have \nfinished SKAT comes forward and bows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNoble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for \n\t\tyour interest. Please remain standing for a\n\t\tlittle longer, or sit on the ground, because \n\t\twe are now going to perform a tragedia about \n\t\tan unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and \n\t\tthe handsome lover -- that's me.\n\nMIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. \nThey bow, to the public. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHere is the husband. Here is the wife. If \n\t\tyou'll shut up over there, you'll see something \n\t\tsplendid. As I said, I play the lover and I \n\t\thaven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to \n\t\thide behind the curtain for the time being. \n\t\t\t(he wipes the sweat \n\t\t\tfrom his forehead)\n\t\tIt's damned hot. I think we'll have a \n\t\tthunderstorm.\n\nHe places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, \nmakes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, \nand disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.\n\nSKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin \nwashbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, \nglittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks \nare flushed rose red.\n<b> \n</b>He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and \nwhistling to himself.\n<b> \n</b>In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received \nwith great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as \nhe gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both \nheight and volume.\n<b> \n</b>SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but \nfiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her \nshoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her \ngenerous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity \nallow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye \nimmediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.\n\nNow she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing \nseveral dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages \nnot to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the \nwagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.\n<b> \n</b>The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment \nthe actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.\n\nWhen he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from \nthe wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.\n\nShe becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy \nglance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her \nsmall, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in \nthe bushes.\n\nNow she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any \nlonger. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack \nof food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant \nexpression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.\n\nSKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the \nchicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.\n\nHis words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and \npulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance \nand tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with \nfrightened shrieks.\n\n\n\nJOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends \nto be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNight and moonlight now prevail \n\t\tHere sleeps my wife so frail ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC\n</b>\t\tDoes she snore?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMay I point out that this is a tragedy, and in \n\t\ttragedies one doesn't snore.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC\n</b>\t\tI think she should snore anyhow. \n\nThis opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and \ngoes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNight and moonlight now prevail.\n\t\tThere snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. \n\t\tJealous I am, as never before, \n\t\tI hide myself behind this door. \n\t\tFaithful is she \n\t\tTo her lover -- not me. \n\t\tHe soon comes a-stealing \n\t\tTo awaken her lusty feeling. \n\t\tI shall now kill him dead \n\t\tFor cuckolding me in my bed. \n\t\tThere he comes in the moonlight, \n\t\tHis white legs shining bright. \n\t\tQuiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, \n\t\tTell him not that he's about to die.\n\nJOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to \nthe left. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tLook, there he comes in the night \n\t\tMy lover, my heart's delight.\n\nShe becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard \nin front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the \nheat.\n<b> \n</b>Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall \nsilent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children \nstop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.\n<b> \n</b>JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression \nof horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the \nyard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to \nmutter half-forgotten prayers.\n\nAll have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is \nheard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the \nhilltop.\n\nThe cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods \npulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters \nwith heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out \nspasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway \nand emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.\n\nAfter the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, \nboys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges \nin their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling \necstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are \ngnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. \nThey bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost \nrhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their \nbursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each\nother and help each other to intensify the scourging.\n\nNow the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks \nfall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed \ntightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered \ncross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, \nbut the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the \nface in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, \nsuffering scorn and shame.\n<b> \n</b>The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where \nthey stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the \nmonks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.\n<b> \n</b>A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-\nbrown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK\n</b>\t\tGod has sentenced us to punishment. We shall \n\t\tall perish in the black death. You, standing \n\t\tthere like gaping cattle, you who sit there in \n\t\tyour glutted complacency, do you know that this \n\t\tmay be your last hour? Death stands right \n\t\tbehind you. I can see how his crown gleams in \n\t\tthe sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it \n\t\tabove your heads. Which one of you shall he \n\t\tstrike first? You there, who stand staring like \n\t\ta goat, will your mouth be twisted into the \n\t\tlast unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, \n\t\twoman, who bloom with life and self-\n\t\tsatisfaction, will you pale and become \n\t\textinguished before the morning dawns? You back\n\t\tthere, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, \n\t\tdo you have another year left to dirty the \n\t\tearth with your refuse? Do you know, you \n\t\tinsensible fools, that you shall die today or \n\t\ttomorrow, or the next day, because all of you \n\t\thave been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do \n\t\tyou hear the word? You have been sentenced, \n\t\tsentenced! \n\nThe MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful\nglance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face\nupwards. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMONK\n</b>\t\tLord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't \n\t\tturn your face from us in loathing and \n\t\tcontempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of \n\t\tyour son, Jesus Christ. \n\nHe makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a\nstrong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some \nsuperhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing \nand moaning.\n\nThe procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; \nothers who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the \nsquire drinks his beer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThis damned ranting about doom. Is that food \n\t\tfor the minds of modern people? Do they really \n\t\texpect us to take them seriously?\n\nThe KNIGHT grins tiredly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me \n\t\tto point out that I've either read, heard or \n\t\texperienced most of the tales which we people \n\t\ttell each other. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(yawns) \n\t\tYes, yes.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tEven the ghost stories about God the Father, \n\t\tthe angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --\n\t\tall these I've accepted without too much \n\t\temotion.\n\nHe leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the \nhead. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(contentedly)\n\t\tMy little stomach is my world, my head is my \n\t\teternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My \n\t\tlegs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty \n\t\tfeet are two splendid starting points for my \n\t\tphilosophy. Everything is worth precisely as \n\t\tmuch as a belch, the only difference being that \n\t\ta belch is more satisfying.\n\nThe beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him \nlike a shadow.\n\nIn the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He \nstops JONS with a roar. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat are you screaming about?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire \n\t\tJns. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's possible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHave you seen my wife?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she \n\t\tlooked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd \n\t\tseen her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tWell, in that case you haven't seen her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMaybe she's run off. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tDo you know anything?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go \n\t\tto the inn. Maybe they can help you.\n\nThe smith sighs sadly and goes inside.\n\nThe inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their \nnewly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns\non an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays\npiercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and\nperspiration.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tYes, it's true! The plague is spreading along \n\t\tthe west coast. People are dying like flies. \n\t\tUsually business would be good at this time of \n\t\tyear, but, damn it, I've still got my whole \n\t\tstock unsold.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tThey speak of the judgment day. And all these \n\t\tomens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands \n\t\tand other monstrosities began pouring out of \n\t\tan old woman, and down in the village another \n\t\twoman gave birth to a calf's head. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment. Imagine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER\n</b>\t\tIt hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely \n\t\tlose our crops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tAnd people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee \n\t\tthe country and carry the plague with them \n\t\twherever they go. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment. Just think, just think! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER \n</b>\t\tIf it's as they say, I suppose a person should \n\t\tlook after his house and try to enjoy life as \n\t\tlong as he can. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tBut there have been other things too, such \n\t\tthings that can't even be spoken of. \n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tThings that mustn't be named -- but the priests \n\t\tsay that the woman carries it between her legs \n\t\tand that's why she must cleanse herself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tJudgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse \n\t\tstand at the bend in the village road. I \n\t\timagine they'll come on judgment night, at \n\t\tsundown.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n</b>\t\tThere are many who have purged themselves with\n\t \tfire and died from it, but the priests say that \n\t\tit's better to die pure than to live for hell.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT \n</b>\t\tThis is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out\n\t\tloud, but all of us know that it's the end. And \n\t\tpeople are going mad from fear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARMER\n</b>\t\tSo you're afraid too. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMERCHANT\n</b>\t\tOf course I'm afraid.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN \n</b>\t\tThe judgment day becomes night, and the angels \n\t\tdescend and the graves open. It will be \n\t\tterrible to see. \n\nThey whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.\n\n\n\nPLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still \ndressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, \nhis face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDo you want this armlet? You can have it \n\t\tcheap. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI can't afford it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tIt's real silver.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's nice. But it's surely too expensive for \n\t\tme. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tExcuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHas she disappeared? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThey say she's run away. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHas she deserted you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWith an actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAn actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I \n\t\tthink you should let her go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou're right. My first thought, of course, was \n\t\tto kill her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing \n\t\tto do. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'm also going to kill the actor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe actor?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOf course, the one she eloped with. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhat has he done to deserve that? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you stupid?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe actor! Now I understand. There are too many \n\t\tof them, so even if he hasn't done anything in \n\t\tparticular you ought to kill him merely because \n\t\the's an actor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou see, my wife has always been interested in \n\t\tthe tricks of the theatre.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd that turned out to be her misfortune. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHer misfortune, but not mine, because a person \n\t\twho's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from \n\t\tany further misfortune. Isn't that true?\n\nNow RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill \nand evil.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tListen, you! You sit there and lie to the \n\t\tsmith. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI! A liar!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tYou're an actor too and it's probably your \n\t\tpartner who's run off with Plog's old lady. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you an actor too?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAn actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tWe ought to kill you; it's only logical. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tYou're really funny.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tHow strange -- you've turned pale. Have you \n\t\tanything on your conscience?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYou're funny. Don't you think he's funny? \n\t\t\t(to Plog)\n\t\tOh, you don't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tMaybe we should mark you up a little with a \n\t\tknife, like they do petty scoundrels of your \n\t\tkind.\n\nPLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tWhat have you done with my wife? \n\nThe room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to \nescape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the \nair and sinks into the table top between his fingers.\n\nJOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as \nif the truth had just become apparent to him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tDo you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked \n\t\tsomeone, or got in the way? I'll leave right \n\t\tnow and never come back.\n\nJOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or \ncome to his defense.\n<b> \n</b><b> \t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tGet up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder. \n\nTrembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a \nword comes out.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tStand on your head so that we can see how good \n\t\tan actor you are.\n\nJOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so\nthat he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one \nhand. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(shouts) \n\t\tWhat have you done with my wife? \n\nPLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over\nhim.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDon't lie there moaning. Get up and dance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI don't want to. I can't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tShow us how you imitate a bear. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI can't play a bear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tLet's see if you can't after all.\n\nRAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on \nhis cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop \non top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.\nSome laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs \nwere about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tUp again! Be a good bear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI haven't done any harm. I haven't got the \n\t\tstrength to play a bear any more.\n\nAt that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals\nout. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at \neach other. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you remember what I was going to do to you \n\t\tif we met again?\n\nRAVAL steps back without speaking. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI'm a man who keeps his word.\n\nJONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers \ntowards the wall.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. \nIn a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and\nthe shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.\n<b> \n</b>The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse \ngrazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son \nin her arms. They play together and laugh happily.\n\nNow, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the \nred clouds over the sea.\n\nNot far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He \nlifts his head.\n\nThe evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and \nthe child. The KNIGHT gets up.\n\nMIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the \n<b>KNIGHT. \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat's his name? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tMikael.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow old is he? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOh, he'll soon be two. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHe's big for his age.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big. \n\nShe puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red \nskirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou played some kind of show this afternoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDid you think it was bad?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou are more beautiful now without your face \n\t\tpainted, and this gown is more becoming.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, \n\t\tso we're in real trouble now.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIs that your husband?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tJonas!

I have often \n\t\twondered why people torture themselves as often \n\t\tas they can. Isn't that so?\n\nShe nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and \nthe noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass \nmound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her \narms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like \na child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and \nsprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?\nWhat is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She \nruns for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's\ndirty, bloody face.\n<b> \n</b>Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his \nforehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems \nunhurt. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOuch, it hurts.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWhy did you have to go there? And of course you \n\t\tdrank.\n\nMIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder \nthan necessary. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOuch! I didn't drink anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tThen I suppose you were boasting about the \n\t\tangels and devils you consort with. People \n\t\tdon't like someone who has too many ideas and \n\t\tfantasies.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI swear to you that I didn't say a word about \n\t\tangels. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tYou were, of course, busy singing and dancing. \n\t\tYou can never stop being an actor. People also \n\t\tbecome angry at that, and you know it.\n\nJOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of \nMIA with an injured expression. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tLook what I bought for you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou couldn't afford it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tBut I got it anyhow.\n\nThe armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her \nwrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each \nother, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and \nsighs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOh, how they beat me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhy didn't you beat them back?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI only become frightened and angry. I never get \n\t\ta chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know \n\t\tthat. I roared like a lion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWere they frightened? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNo, they just laughed.\n\nTheir son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls \nhis son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully \nsniffs at MIKAEL.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you notice how good he smells?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tAnd he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy \n\t\tone. A real acrobat's body.\n\nHe lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, \nremembering the knight's presence. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, this is my husband, Jof. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGood evening. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tGood evening.\n<b> \n</b>JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one \nanother silently.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have just told your wife that you have a \n\t\tsplendid son. He'll bring great joy to you. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYes, he's fine.\n<b>     \n</b>They become silent again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHave we nothing to offer the knight, Mia? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThank you, I don't want anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(housewifely)\n\t\tI picked a basket of wild strawberries this \n\t\tafternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh \n\t\tfrom a cow ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you \n\t\twould like to partake of this humble fare, it \n\t\twould be a great honor. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tPlease be seated and I'll bring the food. \n\nThey sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhere are you going next? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tUp to the saints' feast at Elsinore. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI wouldn't advise you to go there. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWhy not, if I may ask?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThe plague has spread in that direction, \n\t\tfollowing the coast line south. It's said that \n\t\tpeople are dying by the tens of thousands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tReally! Well, sometimes life is a little hard. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tMay I suggest ... \n\t\t\t(JOF looks at him, surprised)\n \t\t... that you follow me through the forest \n\t\ttonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go \n\t\talong the east coast. You'll probably be safer \n\t\tthere.\n\nMIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it \nbetween them and gives each of them a spoon.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI wish you good appetite. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI humbly thank you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tThese are wild strawberries from the forest. I \n\t\thave never seen such large ones. They grow up \n\t\tthere on the hillside. Notice how they smell!\n\nShe points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering \nsome profound thought. JOF eats heartily.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tYour suggestion is good, but I must think it \n\t\tover. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt might be wise to have company going through \n\t\tthe forest. It's said to be full of trolls and \n\t\tghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\t\t(staunchly)\n\t\tYes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I \n\t\thave to think about it. Now that Skat has left, \n\t\tI am responsible for the troupe. After all, I \n\t\thave become director of the whole company.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(mimics) \n\t\tAfter all, I have become director of the whole \n\t\tcompany.\n\nJONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA \npoints with her spoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you want some strawberries?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThis man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, \n\t\tand let us be together.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(stretches herself) \n\t\tOh, how nice this is. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tFor a short while.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNearly always. One day is like another. There \n\t\tis nothing strange about that. The summer, of \n\t\tcourse, is better than the winter, because in \n\t\tsummer you don't have to be cold. But spring is \n\t\tbest of all.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps \n\t\tyou'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre. \n\nHe sprints towards the wagon.\n<b> \n</b><b> \t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNot now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by \n\t\tyour songs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(politely) \n\t\tBy all means. I write little songs myself. For \n\t\texample, I know a very funny song about a \n\t\twanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet. \n\nThe KNIGHT looks at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou'll not get to hear it either. There are \n\t\tpersons here who don't appreciate my art and I \n\t\tdon't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive \n\t\tsoul.\n\nJOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the \ninstrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies \ndown. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tPeople are troubled by so much.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tIt's always better when one is two. Have you no \n\t\tone of your own?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I think I had someone. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tAnd what is she doing now? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou look so solemn. Was she your beloved? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWe were newly married and we played together. \n\t\tWe laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her \n\t\teyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little \n\t\tears. We went hunting together and at night we \n\t\tdanced. The house was full of life ... \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you want some more strawberries?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tFaith is a torment, did you know that? It is \n\t\tlike loving someone who is out there in the \n\t\tdarkness but never appears, no matter how \n\t\tloudly you call. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't understand what you mean.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tEverything I've said seems meaningless and \n\t\tunreal while I sit here with you and your \n\t\thusband. How unimportant it all becomes \n\t\tsuddenly.\n\nHe takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several \ntimes. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNow you don't look so solemn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI shall remember this moment. The silence, the \n\t\ttwilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,\n\t\tyour faces in the evening light. Mikael \n\t\tsleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to \n\t\tremember what we have talked about. I'll carry \n\t\tthis memory between my hands as carefully as \n\t\tif it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh \n\t\tmilk. \n\nHe turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray \nsky. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd it will be an adequate sign -- it will be \n\t\tenough for me.\n\nHe rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues \nto play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.\n\nThe KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is \nquiet and deserted; the sea is still. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have been waiting for you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tPardon me. I was detained for a few moments. \n\t\tBecause I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in \n\t\tretreat. It's your move.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhy do you look so satisfied? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat's my secret.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tOf course. Now I take your knight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYou did the right thing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHave you tricked me?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOf course. You fell right in the trap. Check! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tWhat are you laughing at?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tDon't worry about my laughter; save your king \n\t\tinstead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou're rather arrogant. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOur game amuses me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIt's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed \n\t\tfor time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI understand that you've a lot to do, but you \n\t\tcan't get out of our game. It takes time.\n\nDEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT \nsmiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tAre you going to escort the juggler and his \n\t\twife through the forest? Those whose names are \n\t\tJof and Mia and who have a small son? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy do you ask? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tOh, no reason at all.\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nImmediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.\nThere is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their \nson, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing. \n\nJONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a \nlast mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands \nand maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the \nsmall windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his \nhands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic \nsob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tGod in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tGood evening.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tAre you sitting here sniveling in loneliness? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a \n\t\trabbit. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get \n\t\trid of a wife in such an easy way.\n\nJONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down \nby his side. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAre you married?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count \n\t\tof all my wives any longer. But it's often that \n\t\tway when you're a traveling man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI can assure you that one wife is worse than a \n\t\thundred, or else I've had worse luck than any \n\t\tpoor wretch in this miserable world, which \n\t\tisn't impossible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, it's hell with women and hell without \n\t\tthem. So, however you look at it, it's still \n\t\tbest to kill them off while it's most amusing.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWomen's nagging, the shrieking of children and \n\t\twet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows \n\t\tand pokes, and the devil's aunt for a \n\t\tmother-in-law. And then, when one wants to \n\t\tsleep after a long day, there's a new song -- \n\t\ttears, whining and moans loud enough to wake \n\t\tthe dead. \n\nJONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's \nvoice. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you kiss me good night?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(in the same way)\n\t\tWhy don't you sing a song for me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you love me the way you did when we \n\t\tfirst met?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you look at my new slip? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou only turn your back and snore. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh hell!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(furious) \n\t\tI'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in \n\t\ttheir chests with a small hammer, I'll tap \n\t\ttheir heads ever so lightly with a sledge.\n\nPLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of \nsorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS\n</b>\t\tLook how he howls again. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tMaybe I love her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSo, maybe you love her! Then, you poor \n\t\tmisguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is \n\t\tanother word for lust, plus lust, plus lust \n\t\tand a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and \n\t\tall kinds of other fooling around. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tYes, but it hurts anyway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOf course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, \n\t\tand if one could die of it, there would be \n\t\tsome pleasure in love. But you almost always \n\t\tget over it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tNo, no, not me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, you too. There are only a couple of poor \n\t\twretches who die of love once in a while. Love \n\t\tis as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats \n\t\taway at your strength, your independence, your \n\t\tmorale, if you have any. If everything is \n\t\timperfect in this imperfect world, love is most \n\t\tperfect in its perfect imperfection.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou're happy, you with your oily words, and, \n\t\tbesides, you believe your own drivel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tBelieve! Who said that I believed it? But I \n\t\tlove to give good advice. If you ask me for \n\t\tadvice you'll get two pieces for the price of \n\t\tone, because after all I really am an educated \n\t\tman.\n\nJONS gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands. PLOG becomes \nvery unhappy and grabs his belt. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tListen, Jns. May I go with you through the \n\t\tforest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home \n\t\tbecause everyone will laugh at me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOnly if you don't whimper all the time, because \n\t\tin that case we'll all have to avoid you.\n\nPLOG gets up and embraces JONS. Slightly drunk, the two new friends walk \ntowards the door.\n<b> \n</b>When they come out in the yard, JOF immediately catches sight of them, \nbecomes angry and yells a warning to JONS.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tJns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all \n\t\tthe time. He's not quite sane.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, but now he's just sniveling.\n\nPLOG steps up to JOF, who blanches with fear. PLOG offers his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have \n\t\tsuch a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.\n\nJOF gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and \nsqueezed. While JOF tries to straighten out his fingers, PLOG is seized by \ngreat good will and opens his arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tCome in my arms, little brother.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now \n\t\twe're really in a hurry.\n\nJOF climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe small company is on its way towards the forest and the night.\n\nIt is dark in the forest.\n<b> \n</b>First comes the KNIGHT on his large horse. Then JOF and MIA follow, sitting \nclose to each other in the juggler's wagon. MIA holds her son in her arms. \nJONS follows them with his heavily laden horse. He has the smith in tow. The \nGIRL sits on top of the load on the horse's back, hunched over as if asleep.\n\nThe footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing \n-- yet it is quiet.\n<b> \n</b>Then the moon sails out of the clouds. The forest suddenly becomes alive with \nthe night's unreality. The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of \nthe beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow.\n\nThe wanderers stop. Their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding. Their \nfaces are pale and unreal in the floating light. It is very quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG\n</b>\t\tNow the moon has come out of the clouds. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's good. Now we can see the road better. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI don't like the moon tonight. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe trees stand so still.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tThat's because there's no wind. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI guess he means that they stand very still. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's completely quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIf one could hear a fox at least. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tOr an owl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tOr a human voice besides one's own.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tThey say it's dangerous to remain standing in \n\t\tmoonlight.\n\nSuddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest \nroad, a ghostlike cart emerges. It is the WITCH being taken to the place \nwhere she will be burned. Next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly, \ncarrying their lances on their backs. The girl sits in the cart, bound with \niron chains around her throat and arms. She stares fixedly into the \nmoonlight.\n<b> \n</b>A black figure sits next to her, a monk with his hood pulled down over his \nhead. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhere are you going? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tTo the place of execution.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done \n\t\tit with the Black One. The witch?\n\nThe SOLDIER nods sourly. Hesitantly, the travelers follow. The KNIGHT guides \nhis horse over to the side of the cart. The WITCH seems to be half-conscious, \nbut her eyes are wide open.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI see that they have hurt your hands.\n\nThe WITCH'S pale, childish face turns towards the KNIGHT and she shakes her \nhead. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI have a potion that will stop your pain.\n\nShe shakes her head again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhy do you burn her at this time of night? \n\t\tPeople have so few diversions these days.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tSaints preserve us, be quiet! It's said that \n\t\tshe brings the Devil with her wherever she \n\t\tgoes. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou are eight brave men, then.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER \n</b>\t\tWell, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer \n\t\tjob. \n\nThe SOLDIER speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the WITCH.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(to the WITCH)\n\t\tWhat's your name? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tMy name is Tyan, my lord. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow old are you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tFourteen, my lord.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd is it true that you have been in league \n\t\twith the Devil?\n\nTYAN nods quietly and looks away. Now they arrive at the parish border. At \nthe foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads. The pyre has already been \nstacked in the center of the forest clearing. The travelers remain there, \nhesitant and curious.\n<b> \n</b>The soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams.\nThey nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder. TYAN will be \nbound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry.\n\nThe sound of the hammering echoes through the forest. The KNIGHT has \ndismounted and walks closer to the cart. Again he tries to catch TYAN'S eyes, \ntouches her very lightly as if to waken her. Slowly she turns her face \ntowards him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThey say that you have been in league with the \n\t\tDevil.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tWhy do you ask?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNot out of curiosity, but for very personal \n\t\treasons. I too want to meet him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tWhy?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, \n\t\tmust know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tYou can see him anytime. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHow?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tYou must do as I tell you.\n\nThe KNIGHT grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles \nwhiten. TYAN leans forward and joins her gaze with his. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tLook into my eyes.\n\nThe KNIGHT meets her gaze. They stare at each other for a long time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see? Do you see him?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear. \n\t\tBut nothing else.\n\nHe falls silent. The soldiers work at the stakes; their hammering echoes in \nthe forest. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tNo one, nothing, no one? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN\n</b>\t\tCan't you see him behind your back? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(looks around) \n\t\tNo, there is no one there. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tBut he is with me everywhere. I only have to \n\t\tstretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He \n\t\tis with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He \n\t\twill protect me from everything evil.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHas he told you this? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tI know it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tHas he said it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTYAN \n</b>\t\tI know it, I know it. You must see him \n\t\tsomewhere, you must. The priests had no \n\t\tdifficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers. \n\t\tThey are so afraid of him that they don't even \n\t\tdare touch me.\n\nThe sounds of the hammers stops. The soldiers stand like black shadows rooted \nin the moss. They fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron. TYAN \nmoans weakly, as if she were far away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhy have you crushed her hands? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\t\t(surly) \n\t\tWe didn't do it. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWho did? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tAsk the monk.\n\nThe soldiers pull the iron and the chains. TYAN'S shaven head sways, gleaming \nin the moonlight. Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound \nemerges. They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and \nthe stake. The KNIGHT turns to the MONK, who remains seated in the cart. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat have you done with the child? \n\nDEATH turns around and looks at him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tDon't you ever stop asking questions? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo, I'll never stop.\n\nThe soldiers chain TYAN to the rungs of the ladder. She submits resignedly, \nmoans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position.\n<b> \n</b>When they have fastened her, they walk over to light the pyre. The KNIGHT \nsteps up and leans over her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tFor a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, \n\t\tbut it would do no good. She's nearly dead \n\t\talready. \n\nOne of the soldiers approaches. Thick smoke wells down from the pyre and \nsweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER\n</b>\t\tI've told you to be careful. Don't go too close \n\t\tto her.\n\nThe KNIGHT doesn't heed this warning. He cups his hand, fills it with water \nfrom the skin and gives it to TYAN. Then he gives her a potion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tTake this and it will stop the pain.\n\nSmoke billows down over them and they begin to cough. The soldiers step \nforward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree. TYAN hangs there \nmotionlessly, her eyes wide open.\n\nThe KNIGHT straightens up and stands immobile. JONS is behind him, his voice \nnearly choked with rage. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWhat does she see? Can you tell me? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\t\t(shakes his head) \n\t\tShe feels no more pain. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tYou don't answer my question. Who watches over \n\t\tthat child? Is it the angels, or God, or the \n\t\tDevil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my \n\t\tlord!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThis cannot be.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tLook at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has \n\t\tjust made a discovery. Emptiness under the \n\t\tmoon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWe stand powerless, our arms hanging at our \n\t\tsides, because we see what she sees, and our \n\t\tterror and hers are the same. \n\t\t\t(an outburst) \n\t\tThat poor little child. I can't stand it, I \n\t\tcan't stand it ...\n\nHis voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away. The KNIGHT mounts\nhis horse. The travelers depart from the crossroads. TYAN finally closes her \neyes.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe forest is now very dark. The road winds between the trees. The wagon \nsqueaks and rattles over stones and roots. A bird suddenly shrieks.\n<b> \n</b>JOF lifts his head and wakes up. He has been asleep with his arms around \nMIA's shoulders. The KNIGHT is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks.\n\nHis silence makes him seem almost unreal. JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk \nand support each other. Suddenly PLOG has to sit down. He puts his hands over \nhis face and howls piteously. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh, now it came over me again! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDon't scream. What came over you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tMy wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is \n\t\tso beautiful that she can't be described \n\t\twithout the accompaniment of a lyre.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNow it starts again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHer smile is like brandy. Her eyes like \n\t\tblackberries ...\n\nPLOG searches for beautiful words. He gestures gropingly with his large \nhands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\t\t(sighs) \n\t\tGet up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the \n\t\tothers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a \n\t\tlittle pink potato; her behind is like a juicy \n\t\tpear -- yes, the whole woman is like a \n\t\tstrawberry patch. I can see her in front of me, \n\t\twith arms like wonderful cucumbers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSaints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet, \n\t\tdespite the fact that you're drunk. And your \n\t\tvegetable garden bores me.\n\nThey walk across an open meadow. Here it is a little brighter and the moon \nshimmers behind a thin sky. Suddenly PLOG points a large finger towards the \nedge of the forest. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tLook there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDo you see something? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThere, over there! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tI don't see anything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tHang on to something, my friends. The hour is \n\t\tnear! Who is that at the edge of the forest if \n\t\tnot my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?\n\nThe two lovers discover PLOG and it's too late. They cannot retreat. SKAT \nimmediately takes to his heels. PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and \nbellowing like a wild boar.\n\nFor a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and \nbushes in the gray gloom of the forest. The duel begins to look senseless, \nbecause both of them are equally frightened.\n\nThe travelers silently observe this confused performance. LISA screams once \nin a while, more out of duty than out of impulse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(panting) \n\t\tYou miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven \n\t\tscurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I \n\t\twould be stricken with such eternal shame about \n\t\tmy breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in \n\t\tshort, about my whole body -- that I would \n\t\timmediately rid nature of my own embarrassing \n\t\tself. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(angry) \n\t\tWatch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart \n\t\ton you and immediately blow you down to the \n\t\tactor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and \n\t\trecite monologues to each other until the dust \n\t\tcomes out of the Devil's ears. \n\nThen LISA throws herself around her husband's neck. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tForgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do \n\t\tit again. I am so sorry and you can't imagine \n\t\thow terribly that man over there betrayed me. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI'll kill him anyway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tYes, do that, just kill him. He isn't even a \n\t\thuman being.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tHell, he's an actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tHe is only a false beard, false teeth, false \n\t\tsmiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a \n\t\tjug. Just kill him. \n\nLISA sobs with excitement and sorrow. PLOG looks around, a little confused. \nSKAT uses this opportunity. He pulls out a dagger and places the point \nagainst his breast.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tShe's right. Just kill me. If you thought that \n\t\tI was going to apologize for being what I am, \n\t\tyou are mistaken. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tLook how sickening he is. How he makes a fool \n\t\tof himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, \n\t\tkill him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tMy friends, you have only to push, and my \n\t\tunreality will soon be transformed into a new, \n\t\tsolid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tDo something then. Kill him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed) \n\t\tHe has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYour life's thread now hangs by a very ragged \n\t\tshred. Idiot, your day is short.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tYou'll have to irritate me a little more to get \n\t\tme as angry as before.\n\nSKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes \ntowards the night sky. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tI forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes. \n\nSKAT sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground. The \ntravelers stand confused. PLOG rushes forward and begins to pull at SKAT'S hands. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tOh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, \n\t\tthere's no life left in him. I was beginning to \n\t\tlike him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too \n\t\tspiteful. \n\nJOF leans over his colleague.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tHe's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, \n\t\tI've never seen such a dead actor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tCome on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn \n\t\tover. He has only himself to blame.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tAnd I have to be married to her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tWe must go on.\n\nSKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. \nThe travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on \nthe other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he \nsits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a \nblade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNow that was a good scene. I'm really a good \n\t\tactor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little \n\t\tpleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll \n\t\twait until it becomes light and then I'll find \n\t\tthe easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb \n\t\tup a tree for the time being so that no bears, \n\t\twolves or ghosts can get at me.\n\nHe soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage. He sits \ndown as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\t\t(yawns) \n\t\tTomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll \n\t\tgo to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make \n\t\tlots of money there. \n\t\t\t(yawns)\n\t\tNow, I'll sing a little song to myself: \n\t\t\t(sings) \n\t\tI am a little bird \n\t\tWho sings whate'er he will, \n\t\tAnd when I am in danger \n\t\tI fling out a pissing trill \n\t\tAs in the carnal thrill.\n\t\t\t(speaks)\n\t\tIt's boring to be alone in the forest tonight. \n\t\t\t(sings) \n\t\tThe terrible night doesn't frighten me ... \n\nHe interrupts himself and listens. The sound of industrious sawing is heard \nthrough the silence.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tWorkmen in the forest. Oh, well! \n\t\t\t(sings)\n\t\tThe terrible night doesn't frighten me ... \n\t\t\t(speaks)\n\t\tHey, what the devil ... it's my tree they're \n\t\tcutting down.\n\nHe peers through the foliage. Below him stands a dark figure diligently \nsawing away at the base of the tree. SKAT becomes frightened and angry.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard? \n\t\tWhat are you doing with my tree?\n\nThe sawing continues without a pause. SKAT becomes more frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tCan't you at least answer me? Politeness costs \n\t\tso little. Who are you?\n\nDEATH straightens his back and squints up at him. SKAT cries out in terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'm sawing down your tree because your time is\n\t\tup.\n<b>  \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT\n</b>\t\tIt won't do. I haven't got time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tSo you haven't got time. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNo, I have my performance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tThen it's canceled because of death. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tMy contract.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYour contract is terminated. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tMy children, my family. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tShame on you, Skat! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tYes, I'm ashamed.\n\nDEATH begins to saw again. The tree creaks. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tIsn't there any way to get off? Aren't there \n\t\tany special rules for actors?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNo, not in this case. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tNo loopholes, no exceptions? \n\nDEATH saws.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT\n</b>\t\tPerhaps you'll take a bribe. \n\nDEATH saws.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSKAT\n</b>\t\tHelp!\n\nDEATH saws.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSKAT \n</b>\t\tHelp! Help!\n\nThe tree falls. The forest becomes silent again.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nNight and then dawn.\n\nThe travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss.\nThey lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the \nwind in the tree tops. Here the forest is wild and impenetrable. Huge \nboulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants. A fallen \ntree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow.\n\nMIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at \nthe light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and \nunstable. The KNIGHT sits bent over his chess game. LISA cries quietly behind \nPLOG'S back. JONS lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tSoon dawn will come, but the heat continues to \n\t\thang over us like a smothering blanket.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLISA \n</b>\t\tI'm so frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tWe feel that something is going to happen to \n\t\tus, but we don't know what.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tMaybe it's the day of judgment. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tThe day of judgment ...\n\nNow, something moves behind the fallen tree. There is a rustling sound and a \nmoaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal. Everyone listens\nintently, all faces turned towards the sound. A voice comes out of the\ndarkness. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tDo you have some water?\n\nRAVAL'S perspiring face soon becomes visible. He disappears in the darkness, \nbut his voice is heard again. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tCan't you give me a little water? \n\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\tI have the plague.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tDon't come here. If you do I'll slit your \n\t\tthroat. Keep to the other side of the tree. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI'm afraid of death.\n\nNo one answers. There is complete silence. RAVAL gasps heavily for air. The \ndry leaves rustle with his movements. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tI don't want to die! I don't want to!\n<b> \n</b>No one answers. RAVAL'S face appears suddenly at the base of the tree. His \neyes bulge wildly and his mouth is ringed with foam.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tCan't you have pity on me? Help me! At least \n\t\ttalk to me.\n\nNo one answers. The trees sigh. RAVAL begins to cry. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\tI am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to \n\t\tme! Can no one console me? Haven't you any \n\t\tcompassion? Can't you see that I ...\n\nHis words are choked off by a gurgling sound. He disappears in the darkness \nbehind the fallen tree. It becomes quiet for a few moments.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVAL \n</b>\t\t\t(whispers) \n\t\tCan't anyone ... only a little water. \n\nSuddenly the GIRL gets up with a quick movement, snatches JONS'S water bag \nand runs a few steps. JONS grabs her and holds her fast.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tIt's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no \n\t\tuse. It's meaningless. It's totally \n\t\tmeaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless. \n\t\tCan't you hear that I'm consoling you? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAVEL \n</b>\t\tHelp me, help me!\n\nNo one answers, no one moves. RAVAL'S sobs are dry and convulsive, like a \nfrightened child's. His sudden scream is cut off in the middle. Then it \nbecomes quiet.\n<b> \n</b>The GIRL sinks down and hides her face in her hands. JONS places his hand on \nher shoulder.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>16\n</b>The KNIGHT is no longer alone. DEATH has come to him and he raises his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tShall we play our game to the end? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYour move!\n\nDEATH raises his hand and strikes the KNIGHT'S queen. Antonius Block looks at \n<b>DEATH. \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNow I take your queen. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tI didn't notice that.\n\nThe KNIGHT leans over the game. The moonlight moves over the chess pieces, \nwhich seem to have a life of their own.\n\nJOF has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens. Then he sees the \nKNIGHT and DEATH together. He becomes very frightened and awakens MIA. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tMia!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, what is it?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI see something terrible. Something I almost \n\t\tcan't talk about.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tThe knight is sitting over there playing chess. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYes, I can see that too and I don't think it's \n\t\tso terrible. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tBut do you see who he's playing with? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tHe is alone. You mustn't frighten me this way.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNo, no, he isn't alone. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tWho is it, then?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tDeath. He is sitting there playing chess with \n\t\tDeath himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tYou mustn't say that. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWe must try to escape. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tOne can't do that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tWe must try. They are so occupied with their \n\t\tgame that if we move very quietly, they won't \n\t\tnotice us. \n\nJOF gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. MIA \nremains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. She stares fixedly at the KNIGHT \nand the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI have harnessed the horse. The wagon is \n\t\tstanding near the big tree. You go first and \n\t\tI'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael \n\t\tdoesn't wake up.\n\nMIA does what JOF has told her. At the same moment, the KNIGHT looks up from\nhis game. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tIt is your move, Antonius Block.\n\nThe KNIGHT remains silent. He sees MIA go through the moonlight towards the\nwagon. JOF bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tHave you lost interest in our game?\n<b> \n</b>The KNIGHT'S eyes become alarmed. DEATH looks at him intently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tLost interest? On the contrary.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou seem anxious. Are you hiding anything? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tNothing escapes you -- or does it? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNothing escapes me. No one escapes from me. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIt's true that I'm worried.\n\nHe pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his \ncoat. He looks up at DEATH. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT\n</b>\t\tI've forgotten how the pieces stood.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\t\t(laughs contentedly) \n\t\tBut I have not forgotten. You can't get away \n\t\tthat easily.\n<b> \n</b>DEATH leans over the board and rearranges the pieces. The KNIGHT looks past \nhim towards the road. MIA has just climbed up on the wagon. JOF takes the \nhorse by the bridle and leads it down the road. DEATH notices nothing; he is \ncompletely occupied with reconstructing the game.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tNow I see something interesting. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWhat do you see?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tYou are mated on the next move, Antonius Block. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tThat's true.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tDid you enjoy your reprieve? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tYes, I did.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI'm happy to hear that. Now I'll be leaving you. \n\t\tWhen we meet again, you and your companions' \n\t\ttime will be up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tAnd you will divulge your secrets. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have no secrets. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tSo you know nothing. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEATH \n</b>\t\tI have nothing to tell.\n\nThe KNIGHT wants to answer, but DEATH is already gone.\n\nA murmur is heard in the tree tops. Dawn comes, a flickering light without \nlife, making the forest seem threatening and evil. JOF drives over the \ntwisting road. MIA sits beside him. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA\n</b>\t\tWhat a strange light.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with \n\t\tdawn. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNo, it's something else. Something terrible. Do \n\t\tyou hear the roar in the forest? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt's probably rain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tNo, it isn't rain. He has seen us and he's \n\t\tfollowing us. He has overtaken us; he's coming \n\t\ttowards us. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tNot yet, Mia. In any case, not yet. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tI'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.\n\nThe wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. Now the horse \nstops with his ears flat against his head. The forest sighs and stirs \nponderously. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tGet into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly. \n\t\tWe'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.\n\nThey crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tIt is the Angel of Death that's passing over \n\t\tus, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of \n\t\tDeath, and he's very big.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\tDo you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm \n\t\tterribly cold.\n\nShe shivers as if she had a fever. They pull the blankets over them and lie \nclosely together. The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. The roar \noutside is like a giant bellowing.\n<b> \n</b>\n\nThe castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn. Now\nthe storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and\nabutments.  The sky darkens; it is almost like night.\n\nAntonius Block has brought his companions with him to the castle. But it\nseems deserted. They walk from room to room. There is only emptiness and\nquiet echoes. Outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily.\n\nSuddenly the KNIGHT stands face to face with his wife. They look at each\nother quietly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN\n</b>\t\tI heard from people who came from the crusade \n\t\tthat you were on your way home. I've been \n\t\twaiting for you here. All the others have fled \n\t\tfrom the plague. \n\nThe KNIGHT is silent. He looks at her. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tDon't you recognize me any more? \n\nThe KNIGHT nods, silent. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tYou also have changed.\n\nShe walks closer and looks searchingly into his face. The smile lingers in \nher eyes and she touches his hand lightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tNow I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your \n\t\teyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and \n\t\tfrightened, is that boy who went away so many \n\t\tyears ago. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tIt's over now and I'm a little tired. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tI see that you're tired. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tOver there stand my friends.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tAsk them in. They will break the fast with us. \n\nThey all sit down at the table in the room, which is lit by torches on the \nwalls. Silently they eat the hard bread and the salt-darkened meat. KARIN \nsits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal, \n\t\tthere was silence in heaven for about the space \n\t\tof half an hour. And I saw the seven angels \n\t\twhich stood before God; and to them were given \n\t\tseven trumpets. And another ...\" \n\nThree mighty knocks sound on the large portal. KARIN interrupts her reading \nand looks up from the book. JONS rises quickly and goes to open the door.\n\n<b> \t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"The first angel sounded, and there followed \n\t\thail and fire mingled with blood, and they were \n\t\tcast upon the earth; and the third part of the \n\t\ttrees was burnt up and all the green grass was \n\t\tburnt up.\"\n\nNow the rain becomes quiet. There is suddenly an immense, frightening silence \nin the large, murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over \nthe ceiling and the walls. Everyone listens tensely to the stillness.\n\n<b> \t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a \n\t\tgreat mountain burning with fire was cast into \n\t\tthe sea; and a third part of the sea became \n\t\tblood ...\"\n\nSteps are heard on the stairs. JONS returns and sits down silently at his \nplace but does not continue to eat. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tWas someone there? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJONS \n</b>\t\tNo, my lord. I saw no one.\n\nKARIN lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\t\"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a \n\t\tgreat star from heaven, burning as it were a \n\t\ttorch, and it fell upon the third part of the \n\t\trivers and upon the fountains of waters; and \n\t\tthe name of the star is called Wormwood ...\" \n\nThey all lift their heads, and when they see who is coming towards them\nthrough the twilight of the large room, they rise from the table and stand \nclose together. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNIGHT \n</b>\t\tGood morning, noble lord.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKARIN \n</b>\t\tI am Karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you \n\t\tcourteously to my house.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPLOG \n</b>\t\tI am a smith by profession and rather good at \n\t\tmy trade, if I say so myself.

The wagon stands on a height above a \nslope, protected by an enormous tree. They look across ridges, forests, the \nwide plains, and the sea, which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the \nclouds.\n<b> \n</b>JOF stretches his arms and legs. MIA dries the wagon seat and sits down next\nto her husband. MIKAEL crawls between JOF'S knees.\n\nA lone bird tests its voice after the storm. The trees and bushes drip. From \nthe sea comes a strong and fragrant wind.\n\nJOF points to the dark, retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like \nsilver needles over the horizon. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOF \n</b>\t\tI see them, Mia!

And Death, the severe master, \n\t\tinvites them to dance. He tells them to hold \n\t\teach other's hands and then they must tread the \n\t\tdance in a long row. And first goes the master \n\t\twith his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles \n\t\tat the end with his lyre. They dance away from \n\t\tthe dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the \n\t\tdark lands, while the rain washes their faces \n\t\tand cleans the salt of the tears from their \n\t\tcheeks. \n\nHe is silent. He lowers his hand. His son, MIKAEL, has listened to his words.\nNow, he crawls up to MIA and sits down in her lap. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIA \n</b>\t\t\t(smiling) \n\t\tYou with your visions and dreams.\n<b> \n</b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenplay by Ingmar Bergman \n<b> \n</b>", "answers": ["Lisa, the blacksmith's wife."], "length": 18054, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9fbcbb5460066a68460ba92626c25371e0a1ff65b3bd5e84"}

I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoignés.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging—that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion—particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it’s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I’ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish—I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure—if failure after all it was—had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn’t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram’s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama—which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct—my\nown, as it were, and this other—they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener’s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn’t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother’s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  “It leaves itself!” I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again—the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any—not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram’s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend’s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence—he had a\nworldling’s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade’s joke—I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action—the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my ‘for intérieur’ that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn’t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n“Of course I’ve never seen the fellow, but it’s clear enough he’s a\nhumbug.”\n\n“Clear ‘enough’ is just what it isn’t,” I replied; “if it only were!”\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn’t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering—since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired—that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: “It may be—I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?”—asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn’t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n“Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They’ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don’t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one—luckily perhaps!—with Christian charity.”  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: “I only ask one\nthing—it’s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?”\n\n“A real gentleman, my dear fellow—that’s so soon said!”\n\n“Not so soon when he isn’t!  If they’ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!”\n\n“I might feel injured,” I answered, “if I didn’t reflect that they don’t\nrave about me.”\n\n“Don’t be too sure!  I’ll grant that he’s a gentleman,” Gravener\npresently added, “if you’ll admit that he’s a scamp.”\n\n“I don’t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.”\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn’t change the subject.  “Where did\nthey pick him up?”\n\n“I think they were struck with something he had published.”\n\n“I can fancy the dreary thing!”\n\n“I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.”\n\n“That of course wasn’t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!”  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  “I was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,” Gravener went on, at this, “and I’m too glad you\ndon’t disappoint me.”\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  “He didn’t\nleave her—no.  It’s she who has left him.”\n\n“Left him to us?” Gravener asked.  “The monster—many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.”\n\n“You’ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can’t, no, I really\ncan’t resist the impression that he’s a big man.”  I was already\nmastering—to my shame perhaps be it said—just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n“It’s doubtless only a trifle,” he returned, “but you haven’t happened to\nmention what his reputation’s to rest on.”\n\n“Why on what I began by boring you with—his extraordinary mind.”\n\n“As exhibited in his writings?”\n\n“Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.”\n\n“And what’s it all about?”\n\n“My dear fellow, don’t ask me!  About everything!” I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  “About his ideas of things,” I then more\ncharitably added.  “You must have heard him to know what I mean—it’s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.”  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram’s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk—our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us—it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing—the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?—why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn’t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn’t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n“There’s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.”  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn’t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  “The only thing\nthat really counts for one’s estimate of a person is his conduct.”  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n“None whatever?”\n\n“None whatever.”\n\n“Trust me then to try to be good at any price!” I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  “I declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!”\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram’s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn’t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o’clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I’m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn’t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad—he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company—some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher’s “tail” was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram’s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn’t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn’t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram’s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram’s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I’m bound to say it was we, however—we of both camps, as it\nwere—who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich—I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic—she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt’s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she’d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn’t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram’s circle—at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband—that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  “He doesn’t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,” said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  “She\nsays he drinks like a fish,” she sociably continued, “and yet she allows\nthat his mind’s wonderfully clear.”  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram’s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her—I had it almost on my conscience—what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn’t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity—she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn’t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt’s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled—kindled mainly by his wife’s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  “I suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,” my companion dropped, “and I suppose they’d have done so if I\nhadn’t somehow got an idea that he’s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.”\n\n“So you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you’ve seen!”\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  “Do you mean in his bad faith?”\n\n“In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.”\n\n“The humiliation?”\n\n“Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.”\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  “You don’t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.”\n\n“Oh, you can’t ‘see’ it!” I cried.\n\n“How then do you get at it?”\n\n“You don’t!  You mustn’t suppose he’s good-looking,” I added.\n\n“Why his wife says he’s lovely!”\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram’s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady’s point of view?  “Mrs. Saltram,” I explained,\n“undervalues him where he’s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he’s weak.  He’s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he’s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.”\n\n“Yes, his great eyes,” said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes—the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n“They’re tragic and splendid—lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he’s anything but smart.”\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n“Do you call him a real gentleman?”\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn’t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  “A real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!”\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  “Do you say that because he’s—what do\nyou call it in England?—of humble extraction?”\n\n“Not a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.”\n\n“But isn’t it an awful drawback?”\n\n“Awful—quite awful.”\n\n“I mean isn’t it positively fatal?”\n\n“Fatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.”\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  “And is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?”\n\n“Your questions are formidable, but I’m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.”\n\n“A want of will?”\n\n“A want of dignity.”\n\n“He doesn’t recognise his obligations?”\n\n“On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition’s purely spiritual—it isn’t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices—all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we’re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.”  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts—often tremendous ones.  “But the efforts,” I said,\n“never come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.”\n\n“And how much do they come to?”\n\n“You’re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I’ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there’s no genius to support the\ndefence.”\n\n“But what is there, after all, at his age, to show?”\n\n“In the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?” I\nasked.  “To ‘show’ if you will, there isn’t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn’t as fine, isn’t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n‘Showing’ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,” I went on: “we\nendeavoured, you’ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he’d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.”\n\n“And what would his talk just have been?”\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: “The exhibition of a splendid intellect.”  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn’t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: “The sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal—huge lucid lustrous, a block of light—flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!”\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram’s treachery hadn’t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  “I do want to see that crystal!”\n\n“You’ve only to come to the next lecture.”\n\n“I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.”\n\n“Wait over till next week,” I suggested.  “It’s quite worth it.”\n\nShe became grave.  “Not unless he really comes!”  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim “Ingratitude!”\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn’t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn’t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of—that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none’s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise—since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I’m bound to\nsay he didn’t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination—if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram’s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one’s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent’s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn’t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn’t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance—people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn’t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight’s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles’ drawing-room.  “Yes,” he\nsuggestively allowed, “it’s there, I think, that I’m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven—and if I’ve not been too much worried.”\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o’clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there’s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram’s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram’s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert—they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to “cut”\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn’t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram’s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville’s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for—provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author’s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn’t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the “real gentleman” wasn’t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy à\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon—it was Mrs. Mulville’s work not mine—and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was—a hundred times!—a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn’t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener’s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people—he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram’s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: “I hate\nhis type, you know, but I’ll be hanged if I don’t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.”  I myself should have had some fear—not, I need\nscarcely say, for the “things” themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough—the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges—was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram’s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener’s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with “grounds,” at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor’s widow wouldn’t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody’s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram—who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon’s housekeeper—that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram—that was all.  I didn’t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn’t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency—one had one’s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them—well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don’t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn’t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn’t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram’s had thus remained unanswered—she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country—so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody’s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  “On my election?” he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure—I hadn’t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his “seat.”  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n“Do you mean for her?”  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: “Oh she’s an American, but you’d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,”\nhe added, “by her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn’t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn’t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything’s quite\nsatisfactory.”  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband’s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: “That’s all rot—one’s moved by\nother springs!”\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon’s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight’s widow\nwas again indisposed—she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent’s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  “Good!” I remember crying, “she’ll be put by me;” and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn’t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she’d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: “Oh you don’t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?”  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board—I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: “Those about her husband.”\n\n“Oh yes, but there are some new ones.”\n\n“None for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!”\n\n“Doesn’t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?”\n\n“His fluctuations don’t matter”, I returned, “for at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.”\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n“It’s too bad I can’t see him.”\n\n“You mean Gravener won’t let you?”\n\n“I haven’t asked him.  He lets me do everything.”\n\n“But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.”\n\n“We haven’t happened to talk of him,” the girl said.\n\n“Get him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.”\n\n“I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.”\n\n“Utterly.  But that won’t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.”\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, “I should like to see them,” she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n“They’re tremendously worth it.  You mustn’t miss them.”\n\n“I’ll make George take me,” she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: “But the\nchance of a lecture—one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn’t there another\ncourse announced?”\n\n“Another?  There are about thirty!” I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram’s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener’s marriage was near at hand—was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent’s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn’t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent’s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn’t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn’t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn’t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn’t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  “She likes me—she likes me”:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption—a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman’s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy’s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent’s Park—I mean at Lady Coxon’s\ndoor while his companion paid her call—it wasn’t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener’s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: “I’ve seen him, you know—I’ve seen him!”  She told me\nabout Saltram’s call.\n\n“And how did you find him?”\n\n“Oh so strange!”\n\n“You didn’t like him?”\n\n“I can’t tell till I see him again.”\n\n“You want to do that?”\n\nShe had a pause.  “Immensely.”\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n“Dislike him as much as you will—I see you’re bitten.”\n\n“Bitten?”  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n“Oh it doesn’t matter!” I laughed; “one doesn’t die of it.”\n\n“I hope I shan’t die of anything before I’ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.”\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram—which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville—she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion—that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street—the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift—a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n“What help do you mean?”\n\n“That of the member for Clockborough.”\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: “Why my idea has been to help him!”\n\nShe had helped him—I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble—great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week’s notice.\n\n“Alone?  Gravener has permitted that?”\n\n“What will you have?  The House of Commons!”\n\nI’m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he’d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn’t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers—!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation—he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  “Moi pas comprendre!” I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don’t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  “To take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?” I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn’t look at me, but this didn’t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon—in the Regent’s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n“Oh so charming!” she answered, brightening.  “He said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.”\n\n“Yes, but I’m speaking of the effect on herself.”\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  “It was everything one could\nwish.”\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  “Do you mean she gave him—a dole?”\n\n“Well, since you ask me!”\n\n“Right there on the spot?”\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  “It was to me of course she gave it.”\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn’t see the scene.  “Do you mean a sum of\nmoney?”\n\n“It was very handsome.”  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  “Thirty pounds.”\n\n“Straight out of her pocket?”\n\n“Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn’t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.”  “Oh,” said Adelaide reassuringly, “I\ntake care of it for him!”  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  “I assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.”\n\nBut I wasn’t thinking of that.  “Truly indeed these Americans!” I said.\n“With her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!”\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  “Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt—or whatever he has done—on purpose.  Very likely they won’t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.”\n\n“You say Saltram was very fine?”\n\n“Beyond everything.  He surprised even me.”\n\n“And I know what you’ve enjoyed.”  After a moment I added: “Had he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?”\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  “How can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?”\n\n“Forgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI’m sure he hadn’t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.”\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  “And perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.”\n\n“Perhaps even!  And what was it all about?”\n\n“His talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.”\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one’s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  “It\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.”\n\n“Of illustration?  Indeed I do!”\n\n“And how he has always been right on that great question.”\n\n“On what great question, dear lady, hasn’t he been right?”\n\n“Of what other great men can you equally say it?—and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?” Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n“Didn’t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?” I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n“Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.”  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram’s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  “She said she\nwasn’t disappointed,” Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  “Did he wear his shawl?”\n\n“His shawl?”  She hadn’t even noticed.\n\n“I mean yours.”\n\n“He looked very nice, and you know he’s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression—she said his mind’s like a crystal!”\n\nI pricked up my ears.  “A crystal?”\n\n“Suspended in the moral world—swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe’s monstrously clever, you know.”\n\nI thought again.  “Monstrously!”\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn’t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn’t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren’t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n“Ah Miss Anvoy’s in America?”\n\n“Her father has got into horrid straits—has lost no end of money.”\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: “I hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.”\n\n“None whatever; moreover it’s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I’m afraid he’s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon’s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven’t got Ruth myself!”\n\n“Surely you haven’t lost her?” I returned.\n\n“She’s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost—telling me to smooth her aunt’s pillow.  I’ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon’t receive her Coxon relations—she’s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she’s hopelessly mad,” said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don’t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn’t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn’t care for her, hadn’t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman—you could never know what she’d see in people—an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: “If you’re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.”  I answered that I’d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: “As I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.”  His tone had much behind it—was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship’s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression—the judgement, he might also say—of another person.\n“I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.” There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: “In fact it’s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.”\n\n“And you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.”\n\n“In advance—that’s quite right.  That’s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn’t made\nup.”  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: “Are you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?”\n\n“Of Research?” I was at sea a moment.\n\n“I give you Lady Coxon’s phrase.  She has it on the brain.”\n\n“She wishes to endow—?”\n\n“Some earnest and ‘loyal’ seeker,” Gravener said.  “It was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband’s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity—the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion—she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory—be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning’s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He’s worst of all\nwhen he’s dead, because then he can’t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man’s aspirations are now in his wife’s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.”\n\n“Her earnest loyal seeker?”\n\n“The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that’s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.”\n\n“His search for what?”\n\n“For Moral Truth.  That’s what Sir Gregory calls it.”\n\nI burst out laughing.  “Delightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It’s a\ncharming idea.”\n\n“So Miss Anvoy thinks.”\n\n“Has she a candidate for the Fund?”\n\n“Not that I know of—and she’s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we’ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.”\n\n“Talk that, as you’ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.”\n\n“She considers there’s something in it,” Gravener said.\n\n“And you consider there’s nothing?”\n\n“It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle—which can’t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal—a\nbench of competent people, of judges.”\n\n“The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?”\n\n“And any one she chooses to invite.”\n\n“But she has invited you,” I noted.\n\n“I’m not competent—I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn’t,” my friend\nwent on.  “The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon’s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British—as if that, as a process, as a ‘Werden,’\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it’s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the ‘Fund’—cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.”\n\n“How can she cling if she’s dying?”\n\n“Do you mean how can she act in the matter?” Gravener asked.  “That’s\nprecisely the question.  She can’t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor—how should she, with the life\nshe has led?—her husband’s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman’s very particular—she says there must be\nno mistake.”\n\nI found all this quite thrilling—I took it in with avidity.  “And if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?” I demanded.\n\n“It goes back to his family, if she hasn’t made some other disposition of\nit.”\n\n“She may do that then—she may divert it?”\n\n“Her hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use?”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use—on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged—the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy’s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.”\n\n“Which Miss Anvoy declined?”\n\n“Except as a formal trust.”\n\n“You mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?”\n\n“On the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,” said\nGravener.  “She only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory’s\nscheme.”\n\n“And you blame her for that?” I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn’t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  “My dear fellow, if I ‘blamed’ the young lady\nI’m engaged to I shouldn’t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.”  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: “I’ve criticised her of course, I’ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.”  Yet it clearly couldn’t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother—a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn’t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece’s benefit, but she couldn’t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  “I think you’ll find,” I said with a laugh,\n“that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.”\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  “Who can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?”\n\n“Yes, after all, who indeed?” I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide’s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram’s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion’s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons—the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener’s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn’t fear him—he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend’s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon’s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy’s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other’s persons, but how could they know each other’s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn’t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause—learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n“So she has come out to marry George Gravener?” I commented.  “Wouldn’t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?”\n\n“Hasn’t the House just met?” Adelaide replied.  “And for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse—!”  Then she added: “I gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.”\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n“Do you mean she’ll have had to return to _make_ it so?”\n\n“No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.”  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent’s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl’s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn’t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n“Do you mean you’re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?”\n\n“Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.”\n\n“He’ll be all the better to-night,” I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: “What particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?”\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n“Why the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!”\n\nI’m afraid that at this my levity grew.  “Oh that’s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!”  I saw she hadn’t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor’s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us—for there were other\nfriends present—convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn’t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous—to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn’t ourselves believe.  At ten o’clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram’s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I’m of no use when, as a witness,\nI’m appealed to—for they still absurdly contend about it—as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I’ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I’m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock’s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility—a formidable thing certainly to meet—and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn’t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn’t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn’t I who could help her.  I didn’t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn’t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn’t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn’t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble—I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram’s thought—and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn’t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon’s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide’s silence was fully explained later—practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  “What in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?”\n\n“Because she loves me so!” cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn’t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n“And why in the world doesn’t she do do?” I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  “She says you know.”\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: “A condition he makes.”\n\n“The Coxon Fund?” I panted.\n\n“He has mentioned to her his having told you about it.”\n\n“Ah but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?”\n\n“In the most splendid spirit—as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.”  To which my friend added: “Of course she’s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.”\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  “How very awful!”\n\n“Awful?”\n\n“Why, to have anything to do with such an idea one’s self.”\n\n“I’m sure _you_ needn’t!” and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n“He isn’t good enough!” I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: “You haven’t influenced her, I hope!” and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide’s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed—for I had frightened her again—that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy’s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n“She’s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?” I\ndemanded.  “Rich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?”\n\n“That’s for herself to judge.  Besides, it’s not her own money; she\ndoesn’t in the least consider it so.”\n\n“And Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that’s the whole difficulty?”\n\n“The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt’s solicitor.  It’s clear that by Lady Coxon’s will she may have\nthe money, but it’s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle’s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\n\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\n\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.\n\n“Possibly, though I’ve not seen him for months.  It’s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It’s an old wife’s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.”\n\n“Ruth doesn’t insist on that,” said Mrs. Mulville; “and it’s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.”\n\n“Are you repeating _her_ words?” I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  “Oh I’m so sorry!—when?”\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n“For several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.”\n\n“And that’s why you didn’t write?”\n\n“I couldn’t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn’t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,” Mrs. Mulville went on,\n“that she asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.”\n\nI turned this over.  “Why on earth does she want to see me?”\n\n“To talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.”\n\n“As a subject for the prize?”  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: “I think I’ll sail to-morrow for Australia.”\n\n“Well then—sail!” said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  “On Thursday at five, we said?”  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n“In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest—pure celestial light.  You _won’t_ do\nhim an ill turn?” Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n“What danger can equal for him the danger to which he’s exposed from\nhimself?” I asked.  “Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe’ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.”\n\n“A scandal?” Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n“Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?”\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  “He grows\nbigger every day.”\n\n“So do you!” I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first—the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn’t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram’s want of\ndignity.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn’t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn’t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn’t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn’t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn’t discuss with me the primary\nquestion—the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn’t go into—injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one’s mind for one’s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn’t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn’t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position—would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me—whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener—I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn’t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn’t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies’ school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry—for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  “Why not have the courage of one’s forgiveness,” she asked, “as\nwell as the enthusiasm of one’s adhesion?”\n\n“Seeing how wonderfully you’ve threshed the whole thing out,” I evasively\nreplied, “gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.”\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn’t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  “Oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!” she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh “Ah poor\nSaltram!”  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn’t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: “What can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one’s interest in life?”\n\n“Yes, what can one do?”  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur—“Poor George Gravener!”  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn’t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn’t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn’t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself—how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn’t even know and I certainly didn’t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram’s weaknesses—not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy’s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn’t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn’t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn’t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn’t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram’s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman’s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn’t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless—made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy’s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick—a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn’t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn’t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder—wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness—and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: “Come\nback to town with me, old friend—come back and spend the evening.”  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn’t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms—reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me—and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn’t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy’s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: “Oh the\nPudneys!”  I knew their envelopes though they didn’t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn’t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn’t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n“They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn’t your address.”\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  “Why in the world should\nthey write to me?”\n\n“Because they’ve something to tell you.  The worst,” Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him—reasoning that if they weren’t contradicted they’d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram’s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome—they had ceased to be afraid.  “I don’t want to know the worst,” I\npresently declared.\n\n“You’ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.”\n\nI felt it—it was fat and uncanny.  “Wheels within wheels!” I exclaimed.\n“There’s something for me too to deliver.”\n\n“So they tell me—to Miss Anvoy.”\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  “Why don’t they send it to her\ndirectly?”\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  “Because she’s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.”\n\n“And why should that prevent?”\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon’s and of\nMiss Anvoy’s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  “There’s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney’s hand.”\n\nStill I didn’t understand; then it flashed upon me.  “You mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?” I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n“It’s not I—it’s Mr. Pudney!” cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  “It’s his\nown idea.”\n\n“Then why couldn’t he send the letter to you to be delivered?”\n\nMrs. Saltram’s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n“You must make that out for yourself.”\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  “It’s a denunciation?”\n\n“A real lady doesn’t betray her husband!” this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  “Especially to Miss Anvoy, who’s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?” I asked, much at a loss.\n\n“Because she’s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.”\n\n“Thank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?”\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: “There are other things\nin the world than money.”  This hadn’t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  “It’s all in\nkindness,” she continued as she got up.\n\n“Kindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.”\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity “Perhaps you’re no safer than the\nMulvilles!”\n\nI didn’t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n“It’s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,” I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn’t know what I meant by this I added: “You\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you’ll\nprofoundly regret.”  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney’s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn’t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain—as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn’t quite know what it was—it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour—the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant—I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn’t fade, and, individually, it hasn’t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener “with” them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend—a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can’t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn’t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren’t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know—I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n“You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,” he\nsaid.\n\n“It wasn’t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,” I replied; “for it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.”\n\n“Discouraging?”\n\n“On the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.”\n\n“To the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don’t know what you call\ndiscouraging!” Gravener cried.\n\n“Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.”\n\n“I believe she did, but such a thing’s measured by the effect.  She’s not\n‘discouraged,’” he said.\n\n“That’s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that—decidedly!—I can’t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don’t want to!”\n\n“It’s very good of you, damn you!” my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: “You’d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified—perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?”\n\nI braced myself.  “Taking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn’t take its course.  This therefore is what you’re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I’ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.”\n\n“And to invite me to do the same?”\n\n“Oh you don’t require it—you’ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I’ve been requested to deliver to her.”\n\n“And you don’t mean to?”\n\n“There’s only one consideration that would make me,” I said.\n\nGravener’s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive—a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  “What does the letter contain?”\n\n“It’s sealed, as I tell you, and I don’t know what it contains.”\n\n“Why is it sent through you?”\n\n“Rather than you?” I wondered how to put the thing.  “The only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end—may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.”\n\n“My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,” poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  “The offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?”\n\n“No, I’m not,” he slowly brought out.  “But we’re perfectly good\nfriends.”\n\n“Such good friends that you’ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?”\n\n“Removed?” he anxiously repeated.\n\n“If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.”\n\n“Then for God’s sake send it!”\n\n“I’ll do so if you’re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.”\n\n“I’d marry her the next day!” my visitor cried.\n\n“Yes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,” I said, “I’ll engage to hand her the letter before night.”\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, “Hand it to the devil!” he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n“Will you read it or not?” I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram’s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  “Have you brought it with you?”\n\n“No indeed.  It’s at home, locked up.”\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said “Go back and destroy\nit.”\n\nI went back, but I didn’t destroy it till after Saltram’s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They’ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide’s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth’s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They’ve got their carriage back, but what’s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn’t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?", "answers": ["Keep the money."], "length": 22694, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b4fc3cd3603720687018d2b4ec677a948aa3555ed8b218f9"}
