      **TODO: Add script to our project to collect the unifiedcache runtime environment, this following example comes from vllm-ascend**
      ```sh
      npu-smi info
      cat /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/"$(uname -i)"-linux/ascend_toolkit_install.info
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vllm-project/vllm/main/collect_env.py
      # For security purposes, please feel free to check the contents of collect_env.py before running it.
      python collect_env.py
      ```
      It is suggested to download and execute the latest script, as vllm might frequently update the diagnosis information needed for accurately and quickly responding to issues.
