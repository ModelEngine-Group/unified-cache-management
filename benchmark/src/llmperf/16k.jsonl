The soft band (0.2$-$2 keV) sensitivity limit of the slews\n(6$\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) is close to that of the\nROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS; Voges et al.\\ 1999), and in the medium\n(2$-$12 keV) band, the slew data goes significantly deeper\n(4$\\times10^{-12}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) than all other previous\nlarge area surveys. Over 7700 individual sources have so far been\ndetected to a positional accuracy of 8\\arcsec.  For details on the\nthe construction and\ncharacteristics of the first released XMM-Newton slew survey\ncatalogue, see Saxton et al. (2008). For details of the initial\nscience results from the slew survey, see Read et al. (2006).\n\nThe comparison of XMM-Newton slew data with the RASS is now giving,\nfor the first time, the opportunity to find exotic, extreme\nhigh-variability X-ray bursting objects, e.g. tidal disruption\ncandidates (Esquej et al. 2007), and also Galactic novae, flare stars,\nand flaring white dwarfs, plus eclipsing binaries, AGN and blazars. It\nis only with such a large-area survey as the XMM-Newton Slew Survey,\nthat transient events as these have a chance of being caught.\n\nOne such rare event, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, which we here show to be\na new Classical Nova, was discovered in an XMM-Newton slew from 18th\nJuly 2006 at a very high count rate of 23.3\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV). \n\nClassical novae (see Bode \\& Evans 2008 for a review) occur in\ninteracting binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary star\nand a lower-mass secondary star. The nova itself is a cataclysmic\nnuclear explosion caused by the accretion of material (via Roche Lobe\noverflow or wind accretion) from the secondary star onto the surface\nof the white dwarf; here the pressure and temperature at the base of\nthe accreted material becomes sufficient to trigger a thermonuclear\nrunaway. A recent review of the thermonuclear processes powering\nclassical novae can be found in Starrfield et al.\\ (2008).  The\naccreted material is partially expelled, obscuring the X-ray emission\nfrom the surface of the white dwarf. At later stages, the ejected\nmaterial expands further and becomes optically thin, revealing the\nnuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf.  This emission\npeaks in the soft X-ray regime and it is known as the super-soft\nsource (SSS) state (Krautter 2008). Models of the classical nova SSS\nstate can be found in Tuchman \\& Truran (1998) and Sala \\& Hernanz\n(2005).\n\nThough many classical novae have been observed in X-rays in their SSS\nstates (Ness et al.\\ (2007) for example discuss several examples observed with\nSwift), it is in the optical band, early in their outbursts, that\nclassical novae are almost always discovered. This is because they are\nintrinsically optically bright and easily found in inexpensive\nwide-area shallow surveys.  XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual\ntherefore in that it has been discovered, as we shall see, later in\nits evolution, in the SSS X-ray state.\n\nIn this paper we describe the XMM-Newton slew observations\n(Section~2), and the follow-up X-ray observations by the Swift XRT\n(Section~3) and XMM-Newton (Section~4). Multiwavelength observations\nwith Swift-UVOT, Magellan and ASAS are described in Section~5. We then\npresent a discussion of the results (Section~6), and conclusions.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n  \\caption[]\n  {Details of the four XMM-Newton Slew observations and the single (Rev.\\,1378) \n    dedicated XMM-Newton pointed observation.

Details of the standard\nXMM-Newton slew data reduction and analysis used, plus the\nsource-searching and catalogue cross-correlation etc., are presented\nin Saxton et al.  (2008).\n\nThe source passed through the EPIC-pn detector in 14\\,s, at a small\noff-axis angle, such that an effective vignetting-corrected soft band\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) exposure time of 9.8\\,s was achieved.  A total of 229\nsource counts lie within a radius of 20\\arcsec, yielding a (EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV) count rate of 23.4\\,ct s$^{-1}$.\n\nThe source is seen to have no cross-correlation identifications in the\nRASS, and no other multiwavelength candidates within 30\\arcsec\\ in\nSimbad\\footnote{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/},\nNED\\footnote{http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html}, and\nHEASARC\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/}. The position of the\nsource in the sky is such that it lies apparently at the outer eastern\nedge of the LMC.\n\nXMM-Newton has slewed over this region of sky a number of times, and\nthough nothing was detected in previous slews from 7th November 2001\nand 12th January 2004, the source was seen again on 28th September\n2006 (rev.\\,1246, 72 days after the rev.\\,1210 discovery), at the same\nposition, but at a reduced flux level (3.8\\,ct s$^{-1}$; EPIC-pn:\n0.2$-$2\\,keV).  i.e. it had reduced in flux by a factor of $\\approx$6\nin 72 days. XMM-Newton has not slewed over this area of sky since\nrev.\\,1246. Details of the relevant XMM-Newton slews, together with\nthe (0.2$-$2\\,keV) EPIC-pn source position, detected source counts,\ncount rate and detection likelihood are given in\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}.\n\nThe fact that XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is detected in the total-band\n(0.2$-$12\\,keV) and the soft-band (0.2$-$2\\,keV), whilst effectively\nzero counts are seen in the hard-band (2$-$12\\,keV), is immediately\nindicative of the source being very soft. \n\nThe moderately high count rate indicates that the spectrum is affected\nby pile-up (the on-axis limit is 6\\,ct s$^{-1}$ for EPIC-pn full-frame\nmode\n\\footnote{http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm\\_user\\_support/documentation\n  /uhb\\_2.5/index.html}). This distorts the spectrum and makes\nquantitative spectral analysis of the slew data difficult. We\nminimized these effects by following the standard procedure, i.e.\nignoring the central part of the Point Spread Function (PSF), and\nextracted an event spectrum (containing single and double events) of\nthe source from within an annulus of 5\\arcsec$-$30\\arcsec\\ radius,\ncentred on the source position. Unresolved problems associated with\nthe motion of sources across the detector still exist within slew\ndata, and approximations currently have to be made when calculating\nthe associated effective area and detector response matrix files. In\norder to perform qualitative spectral analysis, an effective area file\nwas generated by averaging the individual core-removed effective area\nfiles at 9 different positions along the detector track made by the\nsource. This accounts for the removal of the piled-up core, and takes\nthe vignetting and PSF variations into account to a good\napproximation.  Individual BACKSCAL values have been set by hand, as\nhave the EXPOSURE values, estimated by calculating the distance\ntravelled by the source in detector coordinates and finding the time\ntaken to do this, given a 90\\,deg\\,hr$^{-1}$ slew speed, then\nsubtracting the appropriate fractions for chip gaps and bad pixels.\nFor the response matrix, we used the equivalent canned detector\nresponse matrix for the vignetting-weighted average source position,\nfor single plus double events and for full-frame mode:\nepn\\_ff20\\_sdY6\\_v6.9.rmf. A background spectrum was extracted from a\nmuch larger circular region close to the source and at a similar\noff-axis angle.\n\nTo fit the slew spectral data, and indeed all the high-energy spectra\nin the present paper, the\nXSPEC\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/}\nspectral fitting package has been used. As $\\chi^2$ minimization is\nnot valid when fitting spectra of low statistical quality, for the\nfitting of the slew spectrum (and all the spectral fitting in the\npresent paper), C-statistics have been used. To take into account the\nabsorbing column along the line of sight, the {\\em wabs} model with\nthe {\\em wilm} cosmic abundance table (Wilms et al.\\ 2000) has been\nused throughout the paper. All the errors quoted in the present paper\nare 90\\% confidence intervals, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe rev.\\,1210 slew spectrum shows that the source is very soft, and\nappears consistent with a 63$_{-10}^{+12}$\\,eV black body, absorbed by\na hydrogen column density of\n8.2$_{-4.1}^{+5.4}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. The fit is good, with a\nP-statistic value of 0.11, obtained via the XSPEC {\\em goodness}\ncommand for this fit, based on 5000 random simulations. The best-fit\nhydrogen column is equal to the full Galactic hydrogen column in the\ndirection of the source (8.0$\\pm{1.1}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$; Dickey\n\\& Lockman, 1990, calculated via the FTOOL {\\em\n  nh}\\footnote{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/fhelp/nh.txt}).\nThe slew spectrum, plus the best fit simple black body model and the\ndeviations from the model, are shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{slewspec}. The\nobserved count rate corresponds to a (0.2$-$2\\,keV) flux, corrected\nfor the removal of the saturated PSF core, of\n4.8$^{+2.7}_{-1.6}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (an\nincrease in flux over the RASS upper limit, assuming the same spectral\nmodel, by a factor of more than 500).\n\nSimple power-law, thermal Bremmstrahlung, and other optically thin hot\nplasma models are unable to fit the spectrum adequately well.  Given\nthat we later are able to identify the source as a nova (Section~5.2),\nthen the black-body model will likely be a good approximation.\nFurthermore, as we have obtained here a moderate number of slew\ncounts, the more physically realistic, though more complex atmosphere\nmodel for CO white dwarfs of MacDonald \\& Vennes (1991), provided by\nK.\\,Page (private communication), was attempted.  This model, used\ne.g. to model the nova V1974 Cyg (Balman et al.\\ 1998), yielded a\nmarginal fit (and not formally a more statistically significant fit;\nP-statistic = 0.03, based on 5000 random simulations), with an\neffective temperature of 70$^{+8}_{-6}$\\,eV, an $N_{\\rm H}$ of\n3.7$^{+3.2}_{-2.5}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$, and a PSF-corrected\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) flux of 4.5$^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Note that a smaller $N_{\\rm H}$ (though perhaps\nstill consistent with the full Galactic hydrogen column) is now\nobtained using the white dwarf atmosphere model. (Note that the\nMacDonald \\& Vennes (1991) ONe white dwarf atmosphere model was also\nattempted, but yielded a marginally worse fit than the CO white dwarf\natmosphere model; only the CO atmosphere model has been used in the\nsubsequent analysis).\n\nIt is well known (e.g. Krautter et al.\\ 1996) that, because of the\nenergy-dependent opacity in the white dwarf atmosphere, fits to super\nsoft source novae spectra with black body models give larger fluxes\nand lower temperatures than atmosphere models fit to the same spectra,\nand this is seen in the present case. Thus the black body model\nrequires a larger $N_{\\rm H}$ to fit the same data than the atmosphere\nmodel, as is seen. \n\nThe model normalizations, corrected for the removal\nof the saturated PSF core, can be used to derive an approximate\ndistance to the source.  If we assume a typical emitting region for\nthe white dwarf atmosphere to be of spherical radius 10$^{9}$\\,cm,\nthen, for the black body model, this distance turns out to be\n20$^{+31}_{-10}$\\,kpc. The effects discussed above however can lead to\nusage of the black body model giving rise to an underestimation of the\ndistance.  For the white dwarf atmosphere model, a larger distance of\n71$^{+27}_{-23}$\\,kpc is obtained. Both estimates are consistent with\nthe distance to the LMC ($\\sim$50\\,kpc, see Section~6), and assuming a\ndistance of 50\\,kpc, the black body derived flux corresponds to a\n(pile-up corrected) 0.2$-$2\\,keV X-ray luminosity of\n1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{37}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 20 575 700,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f1.ps}\n\\caption{XMM-Newton Slew spectrum of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 from\n  XMM-Newton revolution 1210.

We received over 14\\,ksec of Swift-XRT time in 7\nseparate observations and the details of these observations are listed\nin Table~\\ref{xrttable}. All of the observations were in photon\ncounting mode and none of the observations showed any times of\nsignificant high-BG flux. In none of the observations did the source\nposition coincide with any of the dead (micrometeorite-induced)\ndetector columns. The analysis has been performed using HEASOFT\nv6.1.2. The individual XRT observations were astrometrically-corrected\nand then stacked to ascertain a best Swift-XRT position $-$ this was\nfound to be 06 06 37.00 -69 49 33.9 (with a 90\\% error radius of\n4.0\\arcsec). Source counts were then extracted from each observation\nfrom a circle of radius of 40\\arcsec\\ at this position. Background\ncounts were extracted from each observation from large-radius\noff-source circles close to the source position. Source counts and\ncount rates for the individual XRT observations are given in\nTable~\\ref{xrttable}.\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n  \\caption[]{Details of the Swift-XRT observations (observation ID, observation date and \n    cleaned exposure time) are tabulated, together with the total (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) background-subtracted \n    counts and count rate from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 (see text).}\n  \\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ccrrr}\n\\hline\nID          & Date     & Exp. & Counts       & Count rate       \\\\ \n            &   (UT)   &  (s) &              & (s$^{-1}$)        \\\\ \\hline \n00030895001 & 28/02/07 & 1955 & 23.9$\\pm$5.1 & 0.0122$\\pm$0.0026  \\\\\n00030895002 & 07/03/07 & 1796 & 15.8$\\pm$4.2 & 0.0088$\\pm$0.0024 \\\\\n00030895003 & 08/03/07 & 1651 & 10.9$\\pm$3.6 & 0.0066$\\pm$0.0022 \\\\\n00030895004 & 08/03/07 & 2547 & 20.6$\\pm$4.8 & 0.0081$\\pm$0.0019 \\\\\n00030895005 & 10/03/07 & 2550 & 29.5$\\pm$5.7 & 0.0116$\\pm$0.0022 \\\\\n00030895006 & 20/03/07 &  552 &  8.6$\\pm$3.2 & 0.0156$\\pm$0.0057 \\\\\n00030895007 & 22/03/07 & 3391 & 24.4$\\pm$5.4 & 0.0072$\\pm$0.0016 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{xrttable}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe observation naturally fell into three time-separated groups, those\nof obs.\\,1, obs.\\,2-5 and obs.\\,6-7.

An\nARF file was created using {\\em xrtmkarf} and the appropriate RMF\n(swxpc0to12\\_20010101v008.rmf) from the Swift-XRT Calibration Database\nwas obtained.\n\nStandard spectral models were again fit to the spectral data using\nXSPEC. Again, C-statistics were used, as was the {\\em wabs} absorption\nmodel with the {\\em wilm} cosmic abundance table. It was again \nobvious that only a very soft spectrum would be appropriate for the\ndata, and the only simple model that was able to fit the data\nadequately was a black-body model of temperature\n$kT$=$59^{+14}_{-10}$\\,eV, with an absorbing hydrogen column of\n9.5$^{+5.0}_{-3.9}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. No sufficiently constrained parameters could\nbe obtained using the CO white dwarf atmosphere model (MacDonald \\&\nVennes 1991). The Swift-XRT spectrum, together with the best-fit black\nbody model is shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{xrtspec}.

Though great care\nshould be taken in interpreting this result, as the black body model\nis possibly overestimating the luminosity, this obtained radius is\nstill consistent with that of moderately massive ($>$1.1$M_{\\odot}$)\nwhite dwarfs (Hamada \\& Salpeter 1961), i.e.\\,the whole white dwarf\nsurface may still be emitting at 59\\,eV.\n\n\\section{Dedicated XMM-Newton observations}\n\nWe were granted an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation,\nonce the source became again visible to XMM-Newton, and a 10\\,ks\nXMM-Newton EPIC observation was made on 19th June 2007 (see\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}). All the XMM-Newton EPIC data, i.e.  the data\nfrom the two MOS cameras and the single pn camera, were taken in\nfull-frame mode with the thin filter in place.  These data from the\nthree EPIC instruments have been reprocessed using the standard\nprocedures in XMM-Newton SAS (Science Analysis System) $-$ v.7.1.0.\nPeriods of high-background, of which there were very few, were\nfiltered out of each dataset by creating a high-energy 10$-$15\\,keV\nlightcurve of single events over the entire field of view, and\nselecting times when this lightcurve peaked above 0.75\\,ct s$^{-1}$\n(for pn) or 0.25\\,ct s$^{-1}$ (for MOS). This resulted in\n$\\approx$9.4(8.0)\\,ks of low-background MOS(pn) data. Details of this dedicated\nXMM-Newton observation, together with source position, and\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) all-EPIC combined (pn, MOS1, MOS2) detected source\ncounts, count rate and detection likelihood are given in\nTable~\\ref{slewtable}.\n\nSource spectra, containing single and double events, were extracted\nfrom the datasets from circles (none of the data were now piled up)\ncentred on the source position. An extraction radius, estimated from\nwhere the radial surface brightness profile was seen to fall to the\nsurrounding background level, was set to 30\\arcsec. Background spectra\nwere extracted from each cleaned dataset from a 40\\arcsec$-$80\\arcsec\\\nannulus centred on the source position. Point sources seen to\ncontaminate these larger-area background spectra were removed from the\nbackground spectra to a radius of 60\\arcsec. ARF files were created\nfor the source spectra, and were checked to confirm that the correct\nextraction area calculations had been performed. Finally RMF response\nfiles were generated.\n \nStandard spectral models were again fit to the spectral data using\nXSPEC. Once again it was obvious that only a very soft model would fit the data; the only\nsimple model that was able to fit the data well (a P-statistic = 0.17,\nbased on 5000 random simulations) was a black-body model of\ntemperature $kT$=70$^{+3}_{-4}$\\,eV, with an absorbing hydrogen column\nof 6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. The spectrum, together with this best-fit\nmodel are shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{xmmspec}. The corresponding\n(0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) flux is only marginally less than the Swift-XRT value\nat 2.2$^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the\nX-ray luminosity (for the assumed distance of 50\\,kpc) is\n6.7$^{+2.5}_{-2.8}\\times10^{34}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=110 15 570 705,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f3.ps}\n\\caption{XMM-Newton ToO spectrum from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933.

This yielded a marginal fit (and formally\na no more statistically significant fit; P-statistic = 0.04, based on\n5000 random simulations), with an effective temperature of\n73$^{+3}_{-2}$\\,eV, and an $N_{\\rm H}$ of\n3.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.8}$$\\times$$10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. Again, usage of the black body model results\nin a larger fitted $N_{\\rm H}$ and a lower fitted temperature than\nwith the atmosphere model. \n\n\nAs before, the model normalization can be used to obtain a cautious\nestimate of the size of the emitting region. For the assumed distance\nof 50\\,kpc, then the black body model returns an emitting region\nradius of only 1.3$\\pm$0.2$\\times$10$^{8}$\\,cm.  Again care should be\ntaken, as this may be an overestimation, the black body model having\nperhaps overestimated the luminosity. For the white dwarf atmosphere\nmodel, a smaller radius of 0.4$\\pm$0.1$\\times$10$^{8}$\\,cm is\nobtained. Note further that the assumption of a larger distance (see\nSection~6) would result in a proportionally larger emitting radius.\nThe range in allowed radius therefore is quite large, and it is not\nimpossible for for the whole of the white dwarf surface to be emitting\nat 70\\,eV. If this is the case, then the white dwarf would have to be\nat the high end of the mass range ($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$; Hamada \\&\nSalpeter 1961). It may be the case then that we are at this point at,\nor close to the end of the SSS phase, where the effective temperature\nhas reached a maximum (Sala \\& Hernanz 2005), as is tentatively seen\nin the spectral fitting results, and where the photospheric radius has\nreached a minimum, close to the white dwarf radius.\n\n\n\\subsection{X-ray variability}\n\nThe full (XMM-Newton slew plus Swift-XRT plus XMM-Newton ToO) X-ray\nlightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 is shown in\nFig.\\,\\ref{lightcurve}. The calculated (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) flux values\nare shown plotted against the number of days since the rev.\\,1210\nXMM-Newton Slew discovery. The first two data points are the\nrev.\\,1210 and the rev.\\,1246 XMM-Newton Slew observations. Then the\nthree nested Swift-XRT points are shown and finally the XMM-Newton ToO\nobservation. The level of RASS upper limit is shown to the bottom\nleft. The (0.2$-$2.0\\,keV) X-ray flux is seen to have dropped by more\nthan two orders of magnitude in 230 days since the discovery, but is\nthen seen to have levelled off for the next 120 days, at a level still\n$\\approx$3 times that of the RASS. Finally, no evidence for any\nshort-term variability (using time bins down to 100\\,s) is seen in the\nhighest statistic continuous X-ray lightcurve (the $\\approx$8.0\\,ksec\nbackground-filtered EPIC-pn lightcurve) obtained from the 19/06/07\nXMM-Newton observation.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=60 60 550 454,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f4.ps}\n\\caption{The full X-ray lightcurve of XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933.

Swift UVOT images in these two filters of the area\nof sky around XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 are shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{uvot}.\n\nPrior to the Swift UVOT observations, a `best-guess' to the possible\ncandidate optical/IR counterpart would have been the USNO-A2.0 source\n0150-04066298 (B~mag: 17.4, R~mag: 16.1), seen 4\\arcsec\\ south of the\nXMM-Newton slew position. The UVOT images however immediately showed\nthat the optically fainter source at position RA, Dec (J2000) = 06 06\n36.4, -69 49 34.3 (error radius: ~0.5\\arcsec) was a very strong UVW2\nsource and very blue, and was very likely the true counterpart to\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933. (The UVW2 filter spans approximately\n800\\AA\\,, centred at $\\approx$1900\\AA)\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=-82 210 695 585,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f5.ps}\n\\caption{Swift UVOT images of the field around XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933 from observation\n  00030895002.

The small circle in the UVW2 image around the\n  bright source is reproduced in the B image, indicating that a faint\n  optical source is also visible at this position.}\n\\label{uvot}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe Swift UVOT pipeline processed data were analysed using the UVOT\nphotometry package {\\em uvotsource} released with\nFTOOLs\\footnote{http://heasarc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/ftools\\_menu.html}.\nThis package performs aperture photometry on pre-specified source and\nbackground regions, accounting for photometric- (via PSF fitting) and\ncoincidence loss- effects using the UVOT calibration files. Source\ncounts were extracted using a 5\\arcsec\\ radius aperture centred on the\nsource, while for the background we used a 10\\arcsec\\ radius aperture\nlocated in a nearby source-free region.  We used a larger background\naperture to effectively smooth over the modulo-8 fixed pattern noise\npresent in UVOT observations and to improve the statistics of the\nbackground counts. Source counts were converted to UVOT UV-magnitudes\nusing the UVW2 zero-point calibration released with version~2.8 (Build\n22) of the CALDB. The source is seen (see Fig.\\,\\ref{uvotlc}) to be\nroughly constant over the short duration of the Swift observations,\nwith a suggestion of a decline towards the end. This is in keeping\nwith the general form of the X-ray lightcurve (Fig.\\,\\ref{lightcurve})\nat this time.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=80 70 535 380,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f6.ps}\n\\caption{Variation of the UVW2 magnitude of the bright UV source\n  during the Swift observations.

UVOT files, created using {\\em uvot2pha} for\nthe five observations (00030895002, 00030895004, 00030895005,\n00030895006 \\& 00030895007) where the UVW2 filter was employed, were\nincorporated into {\\em xspec}, along with the appropriate response\nfile (swuw2\\_20041120v104.rsp) from the Swift-XRT Calibration\nDatabase. We attempted to fit a single black-body spectrum to the\nSwift-XRT+UV data (again using C-statistics, the {\\em wabs} absorption\nmodel and the {\\em wilm} cosmic abundance table, plus the inclusion of\nthe {\\em xspec-redden} component to model the absorption in the UV\nband). The best fit however, with a much lower temperature of\n$kT$=$36^{+3}_{-4}$\\,eV, is a very poor fit to the data; we obtain a\n{\\em goodness} P-statistic value of 0.00, based on 5000 random\nsimulations. This notwithstanding, a flux in the UVW2\n(1.57$-$7.77\\,eV) band of 3.5$\\pm{0.2}\\times10^{-13}$\\,ergs cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ can be obtained, corresponding to a UVW2 luminosity, for the\nassumed distance of 50\\,kpc, of 1.0$\\pm{0.1}\\times10^{35}$\\,ergs\ns$^{-1}$.\n\nThe very poor single black-body fit above, plus the large change in\nfitted temperature is strongly suggestive that a model other than, or\nin addition to the XRT-derived kT=59\\,eV black body model (Section~3)\nshould be used to describe the UVW2 data. As we have no UV data other\nthan in the UVW2 filter, all that can be done is to apply the\nXRT-derived black body model to the UVW2+XRT data, and in doing this,\na large flux excess with respect to the XRT-derived black body model\nis seen in the UVW2 band. This is shown in Fig.\\ref{xrtuvotspec}. This\nexcess in UV emission (most of the $10^{35}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$ discussed\nabove) is likely due to a combination of residual post-nova nuclear\nburning on the surface of the white dwarf, plus accretion in the disk,\nincluding from emission lines. The situation is likely to be rather\ncomplex, depending on the structure of both the ejecta and the\naccretion disk, and is beyond the scope of the present work, where we\nonly have sparse UV data.  For a review of the UV emission from\nclassical novae, see Shore (2008).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=100 15 580 710,clip,width=6.0cm,angle=270]{12082f7.ps}\n\\caption{Swift-XRT spectrum (black) from XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933, plus\n  the best-fit black-body model to this spectrum (Section~3; Fig.\\,2),\n  but extending into the UV to the Swift-UVOT UVW2 flux points (coloured)\n  (see text).

Images were obtained through the Sloan\n$g^\\prime$, $r^\\prime$ and $i^\\prime$ filters. On Nov.~15, 2007\nconditions were photometric and the Landolt field RU 149A was observed\nto flux calibrate the data in the $g^\\prime$, $r^\\prime$ and\n$i^\\prime$--bands.  The Landolt (1992) magnitudes of the standards\nwere converted to Sloan magnitudes using the transformations presented\nin Smith et al.\\ (2002). All the images were debiased and flatfielded\nusing dome flatfield frames. We applied aperture photometry on each of\nthe images using DAOPHOT in \\textsc{IRAF}\\footnote{\\textsc {iraf} is\n  distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories} to\ncompute the instrumental magnitudes of the stars. Differential\nphotometry of the optical counterpart to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933\n(marked by an arrow in Fig.~\\ref{magellan}) was performed with respect\nto the field star (marked with a `c' in Fig.~\\ref{magellan}). This was the\nbrightest isolated and unsaturated star common to all frames.  The\ncalibrated brightness of this comparison star is $g'= 18.42 \\pm 0.04$,\n$r'= 17.85 \\pm 0.06$ and $i'=17.58 \\pm 0.07$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=35 215 575 575,clip,width=8.7cm]{12082f8.ps}\n\\caption{Magellan Clay LDSS3 finder chart. The counterpart to\n  XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 (and the bright Swift-UVOT UVW2-filter\n  source; Figs.\\ref{uvot}\\&\\ref{uvotlc}) is marked with an arrow. The comparison star is\n  shown marked with a 'c'.}\n\\label{magellan}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn addition to the imaging observations described above, we have\nobtained spectroscopic observations on Nov.~13, 14, and 15, 2007 using\nthe VPH All grism, which has 660 lines per mm, and employing a\n1\\arcsec\\ wide slit. This set-up provides a mean dispersion of 2\\AA\\,\nper pixel. For a slit width of 1 arcsecond and a mean seeing close to\n1\\arcsec, the mean spectral resolution is $\\approx$10\\AA. On Nov.~13, 2007\nwe took 4 exposures of 450\\,s each, on Nov.~14, 2007 we took 2\nexposures of 900\\,s each, and on Nov.~15, 2007 we took one 1200\\,s\nexposure with the slit at the parallactic angle. The spectra were bias\nand flatfield corrected, and extracted in \\textsc{IRAF}. The\ninstrumental response was corrected using the spectrophotometric flux\ncalibrators LTT 3218 (Nov.~13), H600 (Nov.~14) and LTT 9293 (Nov.~15).\nSignificant differences in the flux around H$\\alpha$ are apparent with\nthe flux being 50\\% higher during the Nov.~15, 2007 with respect to\nthe Nov.~13, 2007 observations. Since there is no evidence for\nbrightening in the $r^\\prime$ images we attribute the difference to\nthe fact that the source was not observed at the parallactic angle on\nNov.~13 and 14, 2007. We exported the one dimensional spectra to the\nspectral analysis software package \\textsc{molly} for further\nanalysis.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=70 30 600 800,clip,width=6.8cm,angle=270]{12082f9.ps}\n\\caption{Magellan Clay averaged optical spectrum of the optical source\n  associated with XMMSL1 J060636.2-694933. The flux scaling is\n  approximate. The prominent strong emission lines are marked (see\n  text). }\n\\label{optspec}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe have averaged all spectra (see Fig.~\\ref{optspec}). We find several\nstrong emission lines. The strongest of these emission lines are best\ninterpreted as due to [OIII] 4958.9\\AA\\, and 5006.9\\AA\\,, He~II at\n4685.8\\AA\\, and a blend of the H$\\alpha$ plus the [NII] at 6548.1\\AA\\,\nand 6583.4\\AA\\,, lines found often in novae (Williams 1992). In this\ncase the main [OIII] lines appear redshifted by approximately 2000\\,km\ns$^{-1}$. We interprete this as due to clumpy outflows in the nova\nshell. The integrated light from different outflowing parts can also\nexplain the substructure that is present in the [OIII] lines. The\noutflow velocities that we obtain for the H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines\nis $\\approx$350\\,km s$^{-1}$, hence less than that for the [OIII]\nlines.  Note that, if XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 does reside within the\nLMC, then the systematic line-of-sight recession velocity of the LMC,\n262$\\pm$3.4\\,km~s$^{-1}$ (van der Marel et al.\\ 2002), should be taken\ninto account; i.e.\\,a good fraction of the observed H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$\nrecession would then be due to the recession of the LMC itself.\n\n\\subsection{Long-term Optical light curve}\n\nAnalysis of archival robotic optical survey data from 3-minute CCD\nexposures (pixel size 14\\arcsec.8), obtained with a 70\\,mm (200\\,mm\nfocal length) f/2.8 telephoto lens in the course of the All Sky\nAutomated Survey (ASAS; Pojmanski 2002) show that the visual magnitude\nof this source rose from m$_{V}\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}$}$14 to m$_{V}$$\\approx$12 between\nSep.~18, 2005 and Sep.~30, 2005, and then declined rapidly thereafter (see\nFig.\\ref{optlc}). ASAS did not detect any significant emission from\nthe source after around November 2005, the source having dimmed below\nthe limiting magnitude of ASAS.\n\nThe decline from the brightest data point ($\\approx$2.2 magnitudes in\n10 days, then a further $\\sim$1.3 magnitudes in 46 days) suggests that\nthis is a nova of the 'very fast' speed class (Warner 1995, Downes\net al.\\ 2001). We estimate that the time that the light curve takes to\ndecline 2 magnitudes below maximum observed brightness is\n8$\\pm$2\\,days (see Section~6).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[bb=30 78 453 549,clip,width=7.8cm,angle=270]{12082f10.ps}\n\\caption{All Sky Automated Survey V-band magnitudes of the optical counterpart \nto XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, during outburst (late September 2005) and afterwards.}\n\\label{optlc}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe optical spectrum, showing lines of [OIII] 4958.9\\AA\\, and\n5006.9\\AA\\,, He~II at 4685.8\\AA\\, and a blend of the H$\\alpha$ plus\n[NII] at 6548.1\\AA\\, and 6583.4\\AA\\, suggests that\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was a nova, observed (in Nov 2007) in the late\nA$_{0}$ auroral phase. The fact that the observed [OIII] lines are not\nin the more usual, optically thin 3:1 ratio, can be explained in terms\nof a clumpy outflow scenario, whereby individual clumps of both\nrest-frame and redward-shifted material are observed, and the\nsuperposition of these account for the observed [OIII] ratio (note\nfurther that density enhancements can change observed [OIII] ratios to\nmore like $\\sim$1:1). Clumps of material are often seen in nova ejecta\n(e.g. Shara et al.\\ 1997), and outflows of speeds around 2000\\,km\ns$^{-1}$ are not uncommon in novae (e.g. in nova LMC 1991; Schwartz\net al.\\ 2001).\n\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 was likely at its onset (in Oct 2005) a very\nfast, Fe~{\\sc ii} nova (Section~3 and Williams et al.\\ 1991; Williams\net al.\\ 1994). An accurate classification now however is not possible,\nso late after maximum brightness. The soft ($kT_{\\rm\n  eff}$$\\approx$60--70\\,eV) X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was\nin a super-soft source (SSS) state (Krautter 2008) during its\ndiscovery (in July 2006), and throughout its X-ray decline (by more\nthan two orders of magnitude) in the observations of Sept 2006, March\n2007 and June 2007.  Such a state originates from nuclear burning on\nthe surface of the white dwarf, and measurements of the intensity,\nduration, and temperature can be used to estimate the distance to the\nnova and the mass of the white dwarf (e.g. Balman et al.\\ 1998; Lanz\net al.\\ 2005). Indeed, we believe (Section~4) that the white dwarf\nwithin XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 may be quite massive\n($>$1.2$M_{\\odot}$).\n\nAs discussed earlier, classical novae are almost always discovered\noptically in the early phases of their outbursts.\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is very unusual therefore in that it has been\ndiscovered first in X-rays. As such, it is useful to compare it with\nXMMSL1~J070542.7-381442 (also known as V598 Pup; Read et al.\\ 2008),\nanother nova recently discovered (in X-rays) in the XMM-Newton slew\nsurvey. With a peak $m_{V}$ of $\\ltsim12$, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 is\nnot a particularly bright nova (c.f. V598 Pup, which reached an\nm$_{V}$ of $\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$4), and so it is not surprising that it went\nunnoticed, only being discovered in X-rays during the later (here\n291\\,days after the outburst), optically thin nebular phase, when\nclassical novae are typically observed as soft X-ray sources. Though\nthis delay should be taken as a upper limit, it is long when compared\nto V598 Pup ($\\raisebox{-1mm}{$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}$}$127 days), but may instead be more similar to the\ndelays of $\\sim$200 days seen in V1974 Cyg (Krautter et al.\\ 1996),\n$\\sim$6 months of V382 Vel (Orio et al.\\ 2002), and 6$-$8 months of\nV1494 Aql (Drake et al.\\ 2003). In their X-ray monitoring of optical\nnovae in M31, Pietsch et al.\\ (2007) detect 11 out of 34 novae in\nX-rays within a year after their optical outbursts. Seven novae are\nseen to be X-ray bright, several (3$-$9) years after outburst, and\nthree novae showed very short X-ray outbursts, starting within\n50\\,days of outburst, but lasting only two to three months.\nXMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 therefore is not particularly unusual.\n\nA method to estimate the distance to the nova is to use the relation\nbetween the absolute magnitude at maximum brightness and the time that\nthe light curve takes to decline 2 magnitudes below maximum\nbrightness, $t_{2}$ (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995). We have no\ninformation over the 12 days between the data point of maximum\nbrightness and the lower limit prior to this (Fig.\\,\\ref{optlc}), and\ntherefore we have no exact outburst date, nor exact apparent\nmagnitude at outburst.  Assuming for the moment though that we have\ncaught the outburst exactly in the Sep.~30, 2005 observation, then we\ncan estimate (Sect.~5.3) $t_{2}$ to be 8$\\pm$2\\,days, and using this,\nwe can estimate (Della Valle \\& Livio 1995) the absolute magnitude at\nmaximum brightness $M_{V}$ to be --8.7$\\pm$0.6. An absolute magnitude\nof $M_{V}$=--8.7 implies a peak luminosity $\\sim$7 times the Eddington\nluminosity for a 1\\,$M_{\\odot}$ white dwarf. This is quite typical of\nnovae.\n\nWith $A_{V}$=0.39$^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ (90\\% error), as derived (Predehl\n\\& Schmitt 1995) from $N_{\\rm\n  H}$=6.9$^{+1.0}_{-1.6}\\times10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$ (from the highest\nstatistic spectral fit; the XMM-Newton ToO observation), and with\n$M_{V}$=--8.7$\\pm$0.6, and a peak $m_{V}$ of 12.0, we can derive a\ndistance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of 115$^{+43}_{-30}$\\,kpc.  As\ndiscussed above however, we are unsure as to the exact outburst date\nand the maximum brightness at outburst. Our assumed peak $m_{V}$ of\n12.0 is almost certainly an underestimation. Although we have no\ninformation in the 12 days prior to Sep.~30, 2005, a simple linear\nextrapolation of the early October lightcurve back prior to Sep.~30,\n2005 suggests that the actual peak $m_{V}$ was somewhere between 9 and\n12. The corresponding distance estimates are then between 29 and\n115\\,kpc (with a mid-point $m_{V}$=10.5 value yielding a distance\nestimate of 58\\,kpc). Many methods have been used to estimate the\ndistance to the LMC (e.g.  Kovacs 2000, Nelson et al.\\ 2000), but a\nvalue of around 50\\,kpc appears to be quite robust. Our distance\nestimate is certainly consistent with that of the LMC, though the\nerrors are quite large.  It does appear to be the case however, that\nour distance estimate places the source far outside of our own Galaxy.\nThis, together with the source's position on the sky (at the eastern\nedge of the LMC) and the sizable ($\\sim$Galactic) X-ray hydrogen\ncolumn densities obtained from the spectral fits, suggest strongly\nthat XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 lies within the LMC itself.  Note further\nthat the (pile-up corrected) spectral model normalizations to the\ninitial Slew discovery data (Sect.~2) also imply an approximate\ndistance to XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933 of $\\sim$50\\,kpc.\n\nThe source had, at the time of the slew detection, an absorbed\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) X-ray flux of 4.8$^{+2.7}_{-1.6}\\times10^{-11}$\\,ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a 0.2$-$2\\,keV X-ray luminosity\n(at 50\\,kpc) of 1.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\\times10^{37}$\\,ergs s$^{-1}$.\nAssuming instead for the moment a distance more like 100\\,kpc (though\nthis is thought to be well beyond the LMC, e.g. Kovacs 2000), then the\n(0.2$-$2\\,keV) X-ray luminosity of\n5.7$^{+3.0}_{-1.9}\\times$$10^{37}$\\,erg s$^{-1}$ obtained is at the high end of the X-ray luminosities of\nclassical SSS-phase novae discussed e.g.\\,in Orio et al.\\ (2002) and\nNess et al.\\ (2007). As discussed though, we have very likely missed\nthe outburst peak, and as such, our more probable assumed distance of\n50\\,kpc gives rise to a more typical SSS-phase X-ray luminosity.  The\nluminosities of 7$-$8$\\times$$10^{34}$\\,erg s$^{-1}$, obtained during\nthe Swift and pointed XMM-Newton observations, are more typical of\nnovae at later times, when the emission can also sometimes be\ndescribed by a thermal plasma, rather than a black-body type spectrum,\nor a more mixed spectrum, due to the complex structure of the ejecta\nand the accretion disk (Krautter 2008, Shore 2008).\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nA bright X-ray source, XMMSL1~J060636.2-694933, was detected in an\nXMM-Newton slew on 18 July 2006 at a position where no previous X-ray\nsource had been seen. The XMM-Newton slew data, plus follow-up dedicated\nXMM-Newton and Swift observations, plus optical imaging and\nspectroscopic data acquired with the Magellan Clay telescope and \nAll-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data were used to classify the new object\nas a nova, and to examine its properties. The primary conclusions are\nas follows:\n\n  \\begin{itemize}\n\n  \\item The soft X-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a\n    super-soft source (SSS) state at its discovery in July 2007\n    (XMM-Newton slew) and through its X-ray decline (by over two\n    orders of magnitude) in September 2006 (XMM-Newton slew), March\n    2007 (Swift) and June 2007 (XMM-Newton).\n\n  \\item The Magellan optical spectrum (Nov 2007) of the source\n    indicates that it was very likely then a nova in the late\n    A$_{0}$ auroral phase.\n\n  \\item The very fast optical decline (ASAS) during the nova's onset\n    (Oct 2005), indicates that the initial nova was likely of speed class\n    'very fast'.\n\n  \\item The very fast speed, together with the absolute magnitude at\n    maximum brightness and the X-ray absorption, give rise to a\n    distance to the source far beyond our own Galaxy. The large\n    distance, together with the source's position in the sky, at the\n    eastern edge of the LMC, and the spectral information from the\n    X-ray data, are very suggestive that the nova is situated within\n    the LMC itself.\n\n  \\item Analysis of XMM-Newton slew data is continuing to provide a\n    powerful means of finding new X-ray transient objects.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\n\n  The XMM-Newton project is an ESA Science Mission with instruments\n  and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and the USA\n  (NASA).

{"input": "What are the symptoms of vitamin K deficiency?", "context": "Vitamin K - Wikipedia\n(Redirected from Vitamin k)\nThis article needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources. Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2015)\nThis article is about the family of vitamers. For vitamin K1 the form usually used as a supplement, see Phytomenadione.\nVitamin K structures. MK-4 and MK-7 are both subtypes of K2.\nVitamin K deficiency, Warfarin overdose\nVitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins the human body requires for complete synthesis of certain proteins that are prerequisites for blood coagulation and which the body also needs for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The vitamin K-related modification of the proteins allows them to bind calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues[citation needed].\nChemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 and vitamin K2.[1] Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms.\nVitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It may be thought of as the plant form of vitamin K. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2.\nBacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into vitamin K2. In addition, bacteria typically lengthen the isoprenoid side chain of vitamin K2 to produce a range of vitamin K2 forms, most notably the MK-7 to MK-11 homologues of vitamin K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these forms in anaerobic respiration. The MK-7 and other bacterially derived forms of vitamin K2 exhibit vitamin K activity in animals, but MK-7's extra utility over MK-4, if any, is unclear and is a matter of investigation.\nThree synthetic types of vitamin K are known: vitamins K3, K4, and K5. Although the natural K1 and all K2 homologues and synthetic K4 and K5 have proven nontoxic, the synthetic form K3 (menadione) has shown toxicity.[2]\n1.2 Cardiovascular health\n1.4 Coumarin poisoning\n4.1 Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2\n4.2 Vitamin K2\n6 Absorption and dietary need\n7 Dietary reference intake\n10 Biochemistry\n10.1 Function in animals\n10.2 Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins\n10.3 Methods of assessment\n10.4 Function in bacteria\n11 Injection in newborns\n11.3 Controversy\nA review of 2014 concluded that there is positive evidence that monotherapy using MK-4, one of the forms of Vitamin K2, reduces fracture incidence in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and suggested further research on the combined use of MK-4 with bisphosphonates. In contrast, an earlier review article of 2013 concluded that there is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation helps prevent osteoporosis or fractures in postmenopausal women.[3]\nA Cochrane systematic review of 2006 suggested that supplementation with Vitamin K1 and with MK4 reduces bone loss; in particular, a strong effect of MK-4 on incident fractures among Japanese patients was emphasized.[4]\nA review article of 2016 suggested to consider, as one of several measures for bone health, increasing the intake of foods rich in vitamins K1 and K2.[5]\nCardiovascular health[edit]\nAdequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening,[6] but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[7]\nOne 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women.[8]\nVitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; there is however no good medical evidence that supports such claims.[9]\nCoumarin poisoning[edit]\nVitamin K is part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning).[10]\nAlthough allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.[11]\nBlood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4)[12] and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4),[13] showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.[14]\nUnlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels. The U.S. FDA has banned this form from over-the-counter sale in the United States because large doses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.[2]\nPhylloquinone (K1)[15][16] or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.\nSupplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs.[17] Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.[17] The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient.[citation needed] The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin or vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.[18]\nThe newer anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.[19][20]\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone). In menaquinone, the side chain is composed of a varying number of isoprenoid residues. The most common number of these residues is four, since animal enzymes normally produce menaquinone-4 from plant phylloquinone.\nA sample of phytomenadione for injection, also called phylloquinone\nThe three synthetic forms of vitamin K are vitamins K3 (menadione), K4, and K5, which are used in many areas, including the pet food industry (vitamin K3) and to inhibit fungal growth (vitamin K5).[21]\nConversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2[edit]\nVitamin K1 (phylloquinone) – both forms of the vitamin contain a functional naphthoquinone ring and an aliphatic side chain. Phylloquinone has a phytyl side chain.\nThe MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls.[22] While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats[23][24] and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats.[25][26] In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4.[27][28] There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.[29]\nVitamin K2[edit]\nMain article: Vitamin K2\nVitamin K2 (menaquinone) includes several subtypes. The two subtypes most studied are menaquinone-4 (menatetrenone, MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).\nVitamin K1, the precursor of most vitamin K in nature, is a stereoisomer of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as \"vitamin K\") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.\nVitamin K (in animals) is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.[30]\nAt this time[update], 17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered, and they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:\nBlood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z[31]\nBone metabolism: osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), matrix Gla protein (MGP),[32] periostin,[33] and the recently discovered Gla-rich protein (GRP).[34][35]\nVascular biology: growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6)[36]\nUnknown function: proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamyl proteins (PRGPs) 1 and 2, and transmembrane γ-carboxy glutamyl proteins (TMGs) 3 and 4.[37]\nLike other lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D and E), vitamin K is stored in the fatty tissue of the human body.\nAbsorption and dietary need[edit]\nPrevious theory held that dietary deficiency is extremely rare unless the small intestine was heavily damaged, resulting in malabsorption of the molecule. Another at-risk group for deficiency were those subject to decreased production of K2 by normal intestinal microbiota, as seen in broad spectrum antibiotic use.[38] Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce vitamin K production in the gut by nearly 74% in people compared with those not taking these antibiotics.[39] Diets low in vitamin K also decrease the body's vitamin K concentration.[40] Those with chronic kidney disease are at risk for vitamin K deficiency, as well as vitamin D deficiency, and particularly those with the apoE4 genotype.[41] Additionally, in the elderly there is a reduction in vitamin K2 production.[42]\nThe National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated an estimate of what constitutes an adequate intake (AI) for vitamin K in 2001. The NAM does not distinguish between K1 and K2 – both are counted as vitamin K. At that time there was not sufficient evidence to set the more rigorous estimated average requirement (EAR) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) given for most of the essential vitamins and minerals. The current daily AIs for vitamin K for adult women and men are 90 μg and 120 μg respectively. The AI for pregnancy and lactation is 90 μg. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 2–2.5 μg, and for children aged 1 to 18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 μg. As for safety, the FNB also sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin K no UL is set, as evidence for adverse effects is not sufficient. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as dietary reference intakes.[43] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and did not set an UL.[44]\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value (%DV). For vitamin K labeling purposes the daily value was 80 μg, but as of May 2016 it has been revised upwards to 120 μg. A table of the pre-change adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake. Food and supplement companies have until 28 July 2018 to comply with the change.\nSee also: Vitamin K2 § Dietary sources\nK1 (μg)[45]\nKale, cooked\nCollards, cooked\nCollards, raw\nSwiss chard, cooked\nSwiss chard, raw\nTurnip greens, raw\nRomaine lettuce, raw\nTable from \"Important information to know when you are taking: Warfarin (Coumadin) and Vitamin K\", Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health Drug Nutrient Interaction Task Force.[46]\nVitamin K1 is found chiefly in leafy green vegetables such as dandelion greens (which contain 778.4 μg per 100 g, or 741% of the recommended daily amount), spinach, swiss chard, lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) and often the absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils; some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. By way of reference, two tablespoons of parsley contains 153% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin K.[47] Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the USDA-recommended levels.[48] colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of humans' vitamin K needs; newborns often receive a vitamin K shot at birth to tide them over until their colons become colonized at five to seven days of age from the consumption of breast milk.\nThe tight binding of vitamin K1 to thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts makes it less bioavailable. For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat added to it increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.[49]\nMain article: Vitamin K deficiency\nAverage diets are usually not lacking in vitamin K, and primary deficiency is rare in healthy adults. Newborn infants are at an increased risk of deficiency. Other populations with an increased prevalence of vitamin K deficiency include those who suffer from liver damage or disease (e.g. alcoholics), cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel diseases, or have recently had abdominal surgeries. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can occur in people with bulimia, those on stringent diets, and those taking anticoagulants. Other drugs associated with vitamin K deficiency include salicylates, barbiturates, and cefamandole, although the mechanisms are still unknown. Vitamin K1 deficiency can result in coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder.[50]Symptoms of K1 deficiency include anemia, bruising, nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums in both sexes, and heavy menstrual bleeding in women.\nOsteoporosis[51][52] and coronary heart disease[53][54] are strongly associated with lower levels of K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2 (as menaquinones MK-4 through MK-10) intake level is inversely related to severe aortic calcification and all-cause mortality.[8]\nFunction in animals[edit]\nMechanism of action of vitamin K1.\nThe function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a \"Gla protein\". The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.\nWithin the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).[55] Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase[56][57] or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle.[58] Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K1 because, in part, vitamin K1 is continuously recycled in cells.[59]\nWarfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR.[60] This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.\nGamma-carboxyglutamate proteins[edit]\nMain article: Gla domain\nThe following human Gla-containing proteins (\"Gla proteins\") have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.\nGla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.\nAnother interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail Conus geographus.[61] These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.[62]\nMethods of assessment[edit]\nVitamin K status can be assessed by:\nThe prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time required for blood to clot. A blood sample is mixed with citric acid and put in a fibrometer; delayed clot formation indicates a deficiency. This test is insensitive to mild deficiency, as the values do not change until the concentration of prothrombin in the blood has declined by at least 50%.[63]\nUndercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II); in a study of 53 newborns, found \"PT (prothrombin time) is a less sensitive marker than PIVKA II\",[64] and as indicated above, PT is unable to detect subclinical deficiencies that can be detected with PIVKA-II testing.\nPlasma phylloquinone was found to be positively correlated with phylloquinone intake in elderly British women, but not men,[65] but an article by Schurgers et al. reported no correlation between FFQ[further explanation needed] and plasma phylloquinone.[66]\nUrinary γ-carboxyglutamic acid responds to changes in dietary vitamin K intake. Several days are required before any change can be observed. In a study by Booth et al., increases of phylloquinone intakes from 100 μg to between 377 and 417 μg for five days did not induce a significant change. Response may be age-specific.[67]\nUndercarboxylated osteocalcin (UcOc) levels have been inversely correlated with stores of vitamin K[68] and bone strength in developing rat tibiae. Another study following 78 post-menopausal Korean women found a supplement regimen of vitamins K and D, and calcium, but not a regimen of vitamin D and calcium, was inversely correlated with reduced UcOc levels.[69]\nFunction in bacteria[edit]\nMany bacteria, such as Escherichia coli found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11),[70] but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration).[71] For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.\nSome of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen (O2), which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. E. coli, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.\nInjection in newborns[edit]\nThe blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1–4 μg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100 μg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births.[72] Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.\nBleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration.[73][74]\nAs a result of the occurrences of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended 0.5–1 mg of vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.[74]\nIn the UK vitamin K supplementation is recommended for all newborns within the first 24 hours.[75] This is usually given as a single intramuscular injection of 1 mg shortly after birth but as a second-line option can be given by three oral doses over the first month.[76]\nControversy arose in the early 1990s regarding this practice, when two studies suggested a relationship between parenteral administration of vitamin K and childhood cancer,[77] however, poor methods and small sample sizes led to the discrediting of these studies, and a review of the evidence published in 2000 by Ross and Davies found no link between the two.[78] Doctors reported emerging concerns in 2013,[79] after treating children for serious bleeding problems. They cited lack-of newborn vitamin K administration, as the reason that the problems occurred, and recommended that breastfed babies could have an increased risk unless they receive a preventative dose.\nIn the early 1930s, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet.[80] He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College (OAC).[81] McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, had used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites.[82] Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound had been extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as Koagulationsvitamin. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K.[83] Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K (K1 and K2) published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.[84]\nFor several decades, the vitamin K-deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K-deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K-containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).[85]\nThe first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.[86]\nThe precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al.,[87] Nelsestuen et al.,[88] and Magnusson et al.[89]) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had a form of prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K plays a role in a carboxylation reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.\nThe biochemistry of how vitamin K is used to convert Glu to Gla has been elucidated over the past thirty years in academic laboratories throughout the world.\n^ \"Vitamin K Overview\".

{"input": "Which stock market sector achieved the best performance?", "context": "Introduction\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) has increasingly attracted the attention of the financial community. This trend can be explained by at least three major factors. The first factor refers to the business perspective. It is the economics of gaining competitive advantage using alternative sources of data and going beyond historical stock prices, thus, trading by analyzing market news automatically. The second factor is the major advancements in the technologies to collect, store, and query massive amounts of user-generated data almost in real-time. The third factor refers to the progress made by the NLP community in understanding unstructured text. Over the last decades the number of studies using NLP for financial forecasting has experienced exponential growth. According to BIBREF0 , until 2008, less than five research articles were published per year mentioning both “stock market” and “text mining” or “sentiment analysis” keywords. In 2012, this number increased to slightly more than ten articles per year. The last numbers available for 2016 indicates this has increased to sixty articles per year.\nThe ability to mechanically harvest the sentiment from texts using NLP has shed light on conflicting theories of financial economics. Historically, there has been two differing views on whether disagreement among market participants induces more trades. The “non-trade theorem” BIBREF1 states that assuming all market participants have common knowledge about a market event, the level of disagreement among the participants does not increase the number of trades but only leads to a revision of the market quotes. In contrast, the theoretically framework proposed in BIBREF2 advocates that disagreement among market participants increases trading volume. Using textual data from Yahoo and RagingBull.com message boards to measure the dispersion of opinions (positive or negative) among traders, it was shown in BIBREF3 that disagreement among users' messages helps to predict subsequent trading volume and volatility. Similar relation between disagreement and increased trading volume was found in BIBREF4 using Twitter posts. Additionally, textual analysis is adding to the theories of medium-term/long-term momentum/reversal in stock markets BIBREF5 . The unified Hong and Stein model BIBREF6 on stock's momentum/reversal proposes that investors underreact to news, causing slow price drifts, and overreact to price shocks not accompanied by news, hence inducing reversals. This theoretical predicated behaviour between price and news was systematically estimated and supported in BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 using financial media headlines and in BIBREF9 using the Consumer Confidence Index® published by The Conference Board BIBREF10 . Similarly, BIBREF11 uses the Harvard IV-4 sentiment lexicon to count the occurrence of words with positive and negative connotation of the Wall Street Journal showing that negative sentiment is a good predictor of price returns and trading volumes.\nAccurate models for forecasting both price returns and volatility are equally important in the financial domain. Volatility measures how wildly the asset is expected to oscillate in a given time period and is related to the second moment of the price return distribution. In general terms, forecasting price returns is relevant to take speculative positions. The volatility, on the other hand, measures the risk of these positions. On a daily basis, financial institutions need to assess the short-term risk of their portfolios. Measuring the risk is essential in many aspects. It is imperative for regulatory capital disclosures required by banking supervision bodies. Moreover, it is useful to dynamically adjust position sizing accordingly to market conditions, thus, maintaining the risk within reasonable levels.\nAlthough, it is crucial to predict the short-term volatility from the financial markets application perspective, much of the current NLP research on volatility forecasting focus on the volatility prediction for very long-term horizons (see BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 ). Predominately, these works are built on extensions of the bag-of-words representation that has the main drawback of not capturing word order. Financial forecasting, however, requires the ability to capture semantics that is dependent upon word order. For example, the headline “Qualcomm sues Apple for contract breach” and “Apple sues Qualcomm for contract breach” trigger different responses for each stock and for the market aggregated index, however, they share the same bag-of-words representation. Additionally, these works use features from a pretrained sentiment analyis model to train the financial forecasting model. A key limitation of this process is that it requires a labelled sentiment dataset. Additionally, the error propagation is not end-to-end. In this work, we fill in the gaps of volatility prediction research in the following manner:\nRelated work\nPrevious work in BIBREF12 incorporates sections of the “Form 10-K” to predict the volatility twelve months after the report is released. They train a Support Vector Regression model on top of sparse representation (bag-of-words) with standard term weighting (e.g. Term-Frequency). This work was extended in BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 by employing the Loughran-McDonald Sentiment Word Lists BIBREF20 , which contain three lists where words are grouped by their sentiments (positive, negative and neutral). In all these works, the textual representation is engineered using the following steps: 1) For each sentiment group, the list is expanded by retrieving 20 most similar words for each word using Word2Vec word embeddings BIBREF21 . 2) Finally, each 10-K document is represented using the expanded lists of words. The weight of each word in this sparse representation is defined using Information Retrieval (IR) methods such as term-frequency (tf) and term-frequency with inverted document frequency (tfidf). Particularly, BIBREF16 shows that results can be improved using enhanced IR methods and projecting each sparse feature into a dense space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\nThe works described above ( BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 ) target long-horizon volatility predictions (one year or quarterly BIBREF16 ). In particular, BIBREF16 and BIBREF15 uses market data (price) features along with the textual representation of the 10-K reports. These existing works that employ multi-modal learning BIBREF22 are based on a late fusion approach. For example, stacking ensembles to take into account the price and text predictions BIBREF16 . In contrast, our end-to-end trained model can learn the joint distribution of both price and text.\nPredicting the price direction rather than the volatility was the focus in BIBREF23 . They extracted sentiment words from Twitter posts to build a time series of collective Profile of Mood States (POMS). Their results show that collective mood accurately predicts the direction of Down Jones stock index (86.7% accuracy). In BIBREF24 handcrafted text representations including term count, noun-phrase tags and extracted named entities are employed for predicting stock market direction using Support Vector Machine (SVM). An extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is proposed in BIBREF25 to learn a joint latent space of topics and sentiments.\nOur deep learning models bear a close resemblance to works focused on directional price forecasting BIBREF26 , BIBREF27 . In BIBREF26 , headline news are processed using Stanford OpenIE to generate triples that are fed into a Neural Tensor Network to create the final headline representation. In BIBREF27 , a character-level embedding is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner. The character embedding is used as input to a sequence model to learn the headline representation. Particularly, both works average all headline representations in a given day, rather than attempting to weight the most relevant ones. In this work, we propose a neural attention mechanism to capture the News Relevance and provide experimental evidence that it is a key component of the end-to-end learning process. Our attention extends the previous deep learning methods from BIBREF26 , BIBREF27 .\nDespite the fact that end-to-end deep learning models have attained state-of-the-art performance, the large number of parameters make them prone to overfitting. Additionally, end-to-end models are trained from scratch requiring large datasets and computational resources. Transfer learning (TL) alleviates this problem by adapting representations learnt from a different and potentially weakly related source domain to the new target domain. For example, in computer vision tasks the convolutional features learnt from ImageNet BIBREF28 dataset (source domain) have been successfully transferred to multiple domain target tasks with much smaller datasets such as object classification and scene recognition BIBREF29 . In this work, we consider TL in our experiments for two main reasons. First, it address the question whether our proposed dataset is suitable for end-to-end training since the performance of the transferred representations can be compared with end-to-end learning. Second, it is still to be investigated which dataset transfers better to the forecasting problem. Recently, the NLP community has focused on universal representations of sentences BIBREF17 , BIBREF19 , which are dense representations that carry the meaning of a full sentence. BIBREF17 found that transferring the sentence representation trained on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) BIBREF30 dataset achieves state-of-the-art sentence representations to multiple NLP tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, question-type and opinion polarity). Following BIBREF17 , in this work, we investigate the suitability of SNLI and Reuters RCV1 BIBREF31 datasets to transfer learning to the volatility forecasting task. To the best of our knowledge, the hierarchical attention mechanism at headline level, proposed in our work, has not being applied to volatility prediction so far; neither has been investigated the ability to transfer sentence encoders from source datasets to the target forecasting problem (Transfer Learning).\nOur dataset\nOur corpus covers a broad range of news including news around earnings dates and complements the 10-K reports content. As an illustration, the headlines “Walmart warns that strong U.S. dollar will cost $15B in sales” and “Procter & Gamble Co raises FY organic sales growth forecast after sales beat” describe the company financial conditions and performance from the management point of view – these are also typical content present in Section 7 of the 10-K reports.\nIn this section, we describe the steps involved in compiling our dataset of financial news at stock level, which comprises a broad range of business sectors.\nSectors and stocks\nThe first step in compiling our corpus was to choose the constituents stocks. Our goal was to consider stocks in a broad range of sectors, aiming a diversified financial domain corpus. We found that Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) provide a mechanical way to aggregate the most relevant stocks in a given industry/sector. An ETF is a fund that owns assets, e.g. stock shares or currencies, but, unlike mutual funds are traded in stock exchanges. These ETFs are extremely liquid and track different investment themes. We decided to use SPDR Setcor Funds constituents stocks in our work since the company is the largest provider of sector funds in the United States. We included in our analysis the top 5 (five) sector ETFs by financial trading volume (as in Jan/2018). Among the most traded sectors we also filtered out the sectors that were similar to each other. For example, the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both part of the parent Consumer category. For each of the top 5 sectors we selected the top 10 holdings, which are deemed the most relevant stocks. tbl:stockuniverse, details our dataset sectors and its respective stocks.\nStock specific data\nWe assume that an individual stock news as the one that explicitly mention the stock name or any of its surface forms in the headline. As an illustration, in order to collect all news for the stock code PG, Procter & Gamble company name, we search all the headlines with any of these words: Procter&Gamble OR Procter and Gamble OR P&G. In this example, the first word is just the company name and the remaining words are the company surface forms.\nWe automatically derived the surface forms for each stock by starting with a seed of surface forms extracted from the DBpedia Knowledge Base (KB). We then applied the following procedure:\nRelate each company name with the KB entity unique identifier.\nRetrieve all values of the wikiPageRedirects property. The property holds the names of different pages that points to the same entity/company name. This step sets the initial seed of surface forms.\nManually, filter out some noisy property values. For instance, from the Procter & Glamble entity page we were able to automatically extract dbr:Procter_and_gamble and dbr:P_&_G, but had to manually exclude the noisy associations dbr:Female_pads and dbr:California_Natural.\nThe result of the steps above is a dictionary of surface forms $wd_{sc}$ .\nStock headlines\nOur corpus is built at stock code level by collecting headlines from the Reuters Archive. This archive groups the headlines by date, starting from 1 January 2007. Each headline is a html link (<a href> tag) to the full body of the news, where the anchor text is the headline content followed by the release time. For example, the page dated 16 Dec 2016 has the headline “Procter & Gamble appoints Nelson Peltz to board 5:26PM UTC”.\nFor each of the 50 stocks (5 sectors times 10 stocks per sector) selected using the criteria described in sub:corpussecstock, we retrieved all the headlines from the Reuters Archive raging from 01/01/2007 to 30/12/2017. This process takes the following steps:\nFor a given stock code ( $sc$ ) retrieve all surface forms $wd_{sc}$ .\nFor each day, store only the headlines content matching any word in $wd_{sc}$ . For each stored headline we also store the time and timezone.\nConvert the news date and time to Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).\nCategorize the news release time. We consider the following category set: {before market, during market , after market, holidays, weekends}. during market contains news between 9:30AM and 4:00PM. before market before 9:30AM and after market after 4:00PM.\nThe time categories prevents any misalignment between text and stock price data. Moreover, it prevents data leakage and, consequently, unrealistic predictive model performance. In general, news released after 4:00PM EDT can drastically change market expectations and the returns calculated using close to close prices as in the GARCH(1,1) model (see eq:closingreturn). Following BIBREF3 , to deal with news misalignment, news issued after 4:00PM (after market) are grouped with the pre-market (before market) on the following trading day.\ntbl:stocktimecat shows the distribution of news per sector for each time category. We can see a high concentration of news released before the market opens (55% on average). In contrast, using a corpus compiled from message boards, a large occurrence of news during market hours was found BIBREF3 . This behaviour indicating day traders' activity. Our corpus comprise financial news agency headlines, a content more focused on corporate events (e.g. lawsuits, merges & acquisitions, research & development) and on economic news (see tbl:stockheadlinesexmaples for a sample of our dataset). These headlines are mostly factual. On the other hand, user-generated content such as Twitter and message boards (as in BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 ) tends to be more subjective.\nU.S. macroeconomic indicators such as Retail Sales, Jobless Claims and GDP are mostly released around 8:30AM (one hour before the market opens). These numbers are key drivers of market activity and, as such, have a high media coverage. Specific sections of these economic reports impact several stocks and sectors. Another factor that contribute to the high activity of news outside regular trading hours are company earnings reports. These are rarely released during trading hours. Finally, before the market opens news agencies provide a summary of the international markets developments, e.g. the key facts during the Asian and Australian trading hours. All these factors contribute to the high concentration of pre-market news.\nBackground\nWe start this section by reviewing the GARCH(1,1) model, which is a strong benchmark used to evaluate our neural model. We then review the source datasets proposed in the literature that were trained independently and transfered to our volatility prediction model. Finally, we review the general architectures of sequence modelling and attention mechanisms.\nGARCH model\nFinancial institutions use the concept of “Value at risk” to measure the expected volatility of their portfolios. The widespread econometric model for volatility forecasting is the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) BIBREF32 , BIBREF33 . Previous research shows that the GARCH(1,1) model is hard to beat. For example, BIBREF34 compared GARCH(1,1) with 330 different econometric volatility models showing that they are not significantly better than GARCH(1,1). Let $p_t$ be the price of an stock at the end of a trading period with closing returns $r_t$ given by\n$$r_t = \\frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}} - 1 $$   (Eq. 29)\nThe GARCH process explicitly models the time-varying volatility of asset returns. In the GARCH(1,1) specification the returns series $r_t$ follow the process:\n$$r_t &= \\mu + \\epsilon _t  \\\\ \\epsilon _t &= \\sigma _t z_t  \\\\ \\sigma ^2_t &= a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon _{t-1}^2 + b_1 \\sigma _{t-1}^2$$   (Eq. 30)\nwhere $\\mu $ is a constant (return drift) and $z_t$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with mean zero and unit variance. It is worth noting that although the conditional mean return described in eq:garchcondmean has a constant value, the conditional volatility $\\sigma _t$ is time-dependent and modeled by eq:att.\nThe one-step ahead expected volatility forecast can be computed directly from eq:garchcondvariance and is given by\n$$E_T[\\sigma _{T+1}^2] = a_0 + a_1 E_T[\\epsilon ^2] + b_1 E_T[\\sigma _{T}^2] $$   (Eq. 32)\nIn general, the $t^{\\prime }$ -steps ahead expected volatility $E_T[\\sigma _{T+t^{\\prime }}^2]$ can be easily expressed in terms of the previous step expected volatility. It is easy to prove by induction that the forecast for any horizon can be represented in terms of the one-step ahead forecast and is given by\n$$E_T[\\sigma _{T+t^{\\prime }}^2] - \\sigma _u^2 = (a_1 + b_1)^{(t^{\\prime } -1)} \\left(E_T[\\sigma _{T+1}^2] - \\sigma _u^2\\right)$$   (Eq. 33)\nwhere $\\sigma _u$ is the unconditional volatility:\n$$\\sigma _u = \\sqrt{a_0 / (1 - a_1 - b_1)} $$   (Eq. 34)\nFrom the equation above we can see that for long horizons, i.e. $t^\\prime \\rightarrow \\infty $ , the volatility forecast in eq:forecastrecursive converges to the unconditional volatility in eq:unvar.\nAll the works reviewed in sec:introduction ( BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 ) consider GARCH(1,1) benchmark. However, given the long horizon of their predictions (e.g. quarterly or annual), the models are evaluated using the unconditional volatility $\\sigma _u$ in eq:unvar. In this work, we focus on the short-term volatility prediction and use the GARCH(1,1) one-day ahead conditional volatility prediction in eq:forecastoneperiod to evaluate our models.\nLet $\\sigma _{t+1}$ denote the ex-post “true” daily volatility at a given time $t$ . The performance on a set with $N$ daily samples can be evaluated using the standard Mean Squared Error ( $MSE$ ) and Mean Absolute Error ( $MAE$ )\n$$MSE &= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum _{t=1}^{N} \\left( E_t[\\sigma _{t+1}] - \\sigma _{t+1}\\right)^2  \\\\ MAE &= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum _{t=1}^{N}\\left|E_t[\\sigma _{t+1}] - \\sigma _{t+1} \\right|$$   (Eq. 36)\nAdditionally, following BIBREF35 , the models are also evaluated using the coefficient of determination $R^2$ of the regression\n$$\\sigma _{t+1} = a + b E_t[\\sigma _{t+1}] + e_t$$   (Eq. 37)\nwhere\n$$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum _{t=1}^{N}e^{2}_{t}}{\\sum _{t=1}^{N}\\left(E_t[\\sigma _{t+1}] - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum _{t=1}^{N}E_t[\\sigma _{t+1}]\\right)^{2}}$$   (Eq. 38)\nOne of the challenges in evaluating GARCH models is the fact that the ex-post volatility $\\sigma _{t+1}$ is not directly observed. Apparently, the squared daily returns $r_{t+1}^{2}$ in eq:closingreturn could stand as a good proxy for the ex-post volatility. However, the squared returns yield very noisy measurements. This is a direct consequence of the term $z^t$ that connects the squared return to the latent volatility factor in eq:garchwhitenoise. The use of intraday prices to estimate the ex-post daily volayility was first proposed in BIBREF35 . They argue that volatility estimators using intraday prices is the proper way to evaluate the GARCH(1,1) model, as opposed to squared daily returns. For example, considering the Deutsche Mark the GARCH(1,1) model $R^2$ improves from $0.047$ (squared returns) to $0.33$ (intraday returns) BIBREF35 .\nIt is clear from the previous section that any volatility model evaluation using the noisy squared returns as the ex-post volatility proxy will lead to very poor performance. Therefore, high-frequency intraday data is fundamental to short-term volatility performance evaluation. However, intraday data is difficult to acquire and costly. Fortunately, there are statistically efficient daily volatility estimators that only depend on the open, high, low and close prices. These price “ranges” are widely available. In this section, we discuss these estimators.\nLet $O_t$ , $H_t$ , $L_t$ , $C_t$ be the open, high, low and close prices of an asset in a given day $t$ . Assuming that the daily price follows a geometric Brownian motion with zero drift and constant daily volatility $\\sigma $ , Parkinson (1980) derived the first daily volatility estimator\n$$\\widehat{\\sigma _{PK,t}^2} = \\frac{\\ln \\left(\\frac{H_t}{L_t}\\right)^2}{4\\ln (2)} $$   (Eq. 41)\nwhich represents the daily volatility in terms of its price range. Hence, it contains information about the price path. Given this property, it is expected that $\\sigma _{PK}$ is less noisy than the volatility calculated using squared returns. The Parkinson's volatility estimator was extended by Garman-Klass (1980) which incorporates additional information about the opening ( $O_t$ ) and closing ( $C_t$ ) prices and is defined as\n$$\\widehat{\\sigma _{GK,t}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left(\\frac{H_t}{L_t}\\right)^2 - (2\\ln (2) - 1) \\ln \\left(\\frac{C_t}{O_t}\\right)^2 $$   (Eq. 42)\nThe relative noisy of different estimators $\\hat{\\sigma }$ can be measured in terms of its relative efficiency to the daily volatility $\\sigma $ and is defined as\n$$e\\left(\\widehat{\\sigma ^{2}}, \\sigma ^2\\right) \\equiv \\frac{Var[\\sigma ^2]}{Var[\\widehat{\\sigma ^{2}}]}$$   (Eq. 43)\nwhere $Var[\\cdot ]$ is the variance operator. It follows directly from eq:garchwhitenoise that the squared return has efficiency 1 and therefore, very noisy. BIBREF36 reports Parkinson ( $\\widehat{\\sigma _{PK,t}^2}$ ) volatility estimator has 4.9 relative efficiency and Garman-Klass ( $\\widehat{\\sigma _{GK,t}^2}$ ) 7.4. Additionally, all the described estimators are unbiased.\nMany alternative estimators to daily volatility have been proposed in the literature. However, experiments in BIBREF36 rate the Garman-Klass volatility estimator as the best volatility estimator based only on open, high, low and close prices. In this work, we train our models to predict the state-of-the-art Garman-Klass estimator. Moreover, we evaluate our models and GARCH(1,1) using the metrics described in sub:evalution, but with the appropriate volatility proxies, i.e. Parkinson and Garman-Klass estimators.\nTransfer Learning from other source domains\nVector representations of words, also known as Word embeddings BIBREF21 , BIBREF37 , that represent a word as a dense vector has become the standard building blocks of almost all NLP tasks. These embeddings are trained on large unlabeled corpus and are able to capture context and similarity among words.\nSome attempts have been made to learn vector representations of a full sentence, rather than only a single word, using unsupervised approaches similar in nature to word embeddings. Recently, BIBREF17 showed state-of-the-art performance when a sentence encoder is trained end-to-end on a supervised source task and transferred to other target tasks. Inspired by this work, we investigate the performance of sentence encoders trained on the Text categorization and Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks and use these encoders in our main short-term volatility prediction task.\nA generic sentence encoder $S_e$ receives the sentence words as input and returns a vector representing the sentence. This can be expressed as a mapping\n$$S_e \\colon \\mathbb {R}^{T^{S} \\times d_w} \\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}^{d_S}$$   (Eq. 45)\nfrom a variable size sequence of words to a sentence vector $S$ of fixed-size $d_S$ , where $T^{S}$ is the sentence number of words and $d_w$ is the pre-trained word embedding dimension.\nIn the following sections, we describe the datasets and architectures to train the sentence encoders of the auxiliary transfer learning tasks.\nThe Reuters Corpus Volume I (RCV1) is corpus containing 806,791 news articles in the English language collected from 20/08/1996 to 19/08/1997 BIBREF31 . The topic of each news was human-annotated using a hierarchical structure. At the top of the hierarchy, lies the coarse-grained categories: CCAT (Corporate), ECAT (Economics), GCAT (Government), and MCAT (Markets). A news article can be assigned to more than one category meaning that the text categorization task is mutilabel. Each news is stored in a separate XML file. lst:rcv1xmlexample shows the typical structure of an article.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"iso-8859-1\" ?>\n<newsitem itemid=\"6159\" id=\"root\" date=\"1996-08-21\" xml:lang=\"en\">\n<headline>Colombia raises internal coffee price.</headline>\n<dateline>BOGOTA 1996-08-21</dateline>\n<copyright>(c) Reuters Limited 1996</copyright>\n<metadata>\n<codes class=\"bip:topics:1.0\">\n<code code=\"C13\">\n<editdetail attribution=\"Reuters BIP Coding Group\" action=\"confirmed\" date=\"1996-08-21\"/>\n</code>\n<code code=\"C31\">\n<editdetail attribution=\"Reuters BIP Coding Group\" action=\"confirmed\" date=\"1996-08-21\"/>\n</code>\n<code code=\"CCAT\">\n<editdetail attribution=\"Reuters BIP Coding Group\" action=\"confirmed\" date=\"1996-08-21\"/>\n</code>\n<code code=\"M14\">\n<editdetail attribution=\"Reuters BIP Coding Group\" action=\"confirmed\" date=\"1996-08-21\"/>\n</code>\n<code code=\"M141\">\n<editdetail attribution=\"Reuters BIP Coding Group\" action=\"confirmed\" date=\"1996-08-21\"/>\n</code>\n<code code=\"MCAT\">\n<editdetail attribution=\"Reuters BIP Coding Group\" action=\"confirmed\" date=\"1996-08-21\"/>\n</code>\n</codes>\n</metadata>\n</newsitem>\nThe RCV1 dataset is not released with a standard train, validation, test split. In this work, we separated 15% of samples as a test set for evaluation purposes. The remaining samples were further split leaving 70% and 15% for training and validation, respectively.\nRegarding the categories distribution, we found that, from the original 126 categories, 23 categories were never assigned to any news; therefore, were disregarded. From the 103 classes left we found a high imbalance among the labels with a large number of underrepresented categories having less than 12 samples. The very low number of samples for these minority classes brings a great challenge to discriminate the very fine-grained categories. Aiming to alleviate this problem, we grouped into a same class all categories below the second hierarchical level. For example, given the root node CCAT (Corporate) we grouped C151 (ACCOUNTS/EARNINGS), C1511 (ANNUAL RESULTS) and C152 (COMMENT/FORECASTS) into the direct child node C15 (PERFORMANCE). Using this procedure the original 103 categories where reduced to 55. One of the benefits of this procedure was that the less represented classes end up having around thousand samples compared with only 12 samples in the original dataset.\nfig:rcv1arch, shows the architecture for the end-to-end text categorization task. On the bottom of the architecture $S_e$ receives word embeddings and outputs a sentence vector $S$ . The $S$ vector pass through a fully connected (FC) layer with sigmoid activation function that outputs a vector $\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{55}$ with each element $\\hat{y}_j \\in [0,1]$ .\nThe architecture described above is trained under the assumption that each category is independent but not mutually exclusive since a sample can have more than one category assigned (multilabel classification). The loss per sample is the average log loss across all labels:\n$$\\mathcal {L}(\\hat{y}, y) = - \\sum _{i=1}^{55}\\left( y_i \\log (\\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_{i}) \\log (1-\\hat{y}_{i}) \\right)$$   (Eq. 48)\nwhere the index $i$ runs over the elements of the predicted and true vectors.\nGiven the high categories imbalance, during the training we monitor the $F_1$ metric of the validation set and choose the model with the highest value.\nStanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset BIBREF30 consist of 570,000 pairs of sentences. Each pair has a premise and a hypothesis, manually labeled with one of the three labels: entailment, contradiction, or neutral. The SNLI has many desired properties. The labels are equally balanced, as opposed to the RCV1 dataset. Additionally, language inference is a complex task that requires a deeper understanding of the sentence meaning making this dataset suitable for learning supervised sentence encoders that generalize well to other tasks BIBREF17 . tbl:snliexmaples, shows examples of SNLI dataset sentence pairs and its respective labels.\nIn order to learn sentence encoders that can be transfered to other tasks unambiguously, we consider a neural network architecture for the sentence encoder with shared parameters between the premise and hypothesis pairs as in BIBREF17 .\nfig:snliarch, describes the neural network architecture. After each premise and hypothesis is encoded into $S_p$ and $S_h$ , respectively, we have a fusion layer. This layer has no trainable weights and just concatenate each sentence embedding. Following BIBREF17 , we add two more matching methods: the absolute difference $\\vert S_p - S_h \\vert $ and the element-wise $S_p \\odot S_h$ . Finally, in order to learn the pair representation, $S_ph$ is feed into and FC layer with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, which is expressed as $f(x) = \\log (1 + e^x)$ . The last softmax layer outputs the probability of each class.\nFinally, the NLI classifier weights are optimized in order to minimize the categorical log loss per sample\n$$\\mathcal {L}(\\hat{y}, y) = - \\sum _{j=1}^{3}y_i \\log (\\hat{y}_i)$$   (Eq. 52)\nDuring the training, we monitor the validation set accuracy and choose the model with the highest metric value.\nSequence Models\nWe start this section by reviewing the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture and its application to encode a sequence of words.\nRNN's are capable of handling variable-length sequences, this being a direct consequence of its recurrent cell, which shares the same parameters across all sequence elements. In this work, we adopt the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell BIBREF38 with forget gates $f_t$ BIBREF39 . The LSTM cell is endowed with a memory state that can learn representations that depend on the order of the words in a sentence. This makes LSTM more fit to find relations that could not be captured using standard bag-of-words representations.\nLet $x_1, x_2, \\cdots , x_T$ be a series of observations of length $T$ , where $x_t \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_w}$ . In general terms, the LSTM cell receives a previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ that is combined with the current observation $x_t$ and a memory state $C_t$ to output a new hidden state $h_t$ . This internal memory state $C_{t}$ is updated depending on its previous state and three modulating gates: input, forget, and output. Formally, for each step $t$ the updating process goes as follows (see fig:lstmcell for a high level schematic view): First, we calculate the input $i_t$ , forget $T$0 , and output $T$1 gates:\n$$i_t &= \\sigma _s\\left(W_i x_t + U_i h_{t-1} + b_i\\right) \\\\ f_t &= \\sigma _s\\left(W_f x_t + U_f h_{t-1} + b_f\\right) \\\\ o_t &= \\sigma _s\\left(W_o x_t + U_o h_{t-1} + b_o\\right)$$   (Eq. 54)\nwhere $\\sigma _s$ is the sigmoid activation. Second, a candidate memory state $\\widetilde{C}_t$ is generated:\n$$\\widetilde{C}_t = \\tanh \\left(W_c x_t + U_c h_{t-1} + b_c\\right)$$   (Eq. 55)\nNow we are in a position to set the final memory state $C_t$ . Its value is modulated based on the input and forget gates of eq:inputforgetgates and is given by:\n$$C_t = i_t \\odot \\widetilde{C}_t + f_t \\odot C_{t-1}$$   (Eq. 56)\nFinally, based on the memory state and output gate of eq:inputforgetgates, we have the output hidden state\n$$h_t = o_t \\odot \\tanh \\left(C_t\\right)$$   (Eq. 57)\nRegarding the trainable weights, let $n$ be the LSTM cell number of units. It follows that $W$ 's and $U$ 's matrices of the affine transformations have ${n \\times d_w}$ and ${n \\times n}$ dimensions, respectively. Its bias terms $b$ 's are vectors of size $n$ . Consequently, the total number of parameters is $4 (n d_w + n^2 + n)$ and does not depend on the sequence number of time steps $T$ .\nWe see that the LSTM networks are able to capture temporal dependencies in sequences of arbitrary length. One straightforward application is to model the Sentence encoder discussed in sec:transferlearning, which outputs a sentence vector representation using its words as input.\nGiven a sequence of words $\\left\\lbrace w_t\\right\\rbrace _{t=1}^{T}$ we aim to learn the words hidden state $\\left\\lbrace h_t\\right\\rbrace _{t=1}^{T}$ in a way that each word captures the influence of its past and future words. The Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) proposed in BIBREF40 is an LSTM that “reads” a sentence, or any sequence in general, from the beginning to the end (forward) and the other way around (backward). The new state $h_t$ is the concatenation\n$$h_t = [\\overrightarrow{h_t}, \\overleftarrow{h_t}]$$   (Eq. 59)\nwhere\n$$\\overrightarrow{h_t} &= \\text{LSTM}\\left(w_1, \\cdots , w_T\\right) \\\\ \\overleftarrow{h_t} &= \\text{LSTM}\\left(w_T, \\cdots , w_1\\right) \\\\$$   (Eq. 60)\nBecause sentences have different lengths, we need to convert the $T$ concatenated hidden states of the BiLSTM into a fixed-length sentence representation. One straightforward operation is to apply any form of pooling. Attention mechanism is an alternative approach where the sentence is represented as an weighted average of hidden states where the weights are learnt end-to-end.\nIn the next sections we describe the sentence encoders using pooling and attention layers.\nThe max-pooling layer aims to extract the most salient word features all over the sentence. Formally, it outputs a sentence vector representation $S_{MP} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{2n}$ such that\n$$S_{MP} = \\max _{t=1}^{T} h_t$$   (Eq. 62)\nwhere $h_t$ is defined in eq:htconcat and the $\\max $ operator is applied over the time steps dimension. fig:bilstmmaxpool illustrates the BiLSTM max-pooling (MP) sentence encoder.\nThe efficacy of the max-pooling layer was assessed in many NLP studies. BIBREF41 employed a max-pooling layer on top of word representations and argues that it performs better than mean pooling. Experimental results in BIBREF17 show that among three types of pooling (max, mean and last) the max-pooling provides the most universal sentence representations in terms of transferring performance to other tasks. Grounded on these studies, in this work, we choose the BiLSTM max-pooling as our pooling layer of choice.\nAttention mechanisms were introduced in the deep learning literature to overcome some simplifications imposed by pooling operators. When we humans read a sentence, we are able to spot its most relevant parts in a given context and disregard information that is redundant or misleading. The attention model aims to mimic this behaviour.\nAttention layers were proposed for different NLP tasks. For example, NLI, with cross-attention between premise and hypothesis, Question & Answering and Machine Translation (MT). Specifically in the Machine Translation task, each word in the target sentence learns to attend the relevant words of the source sentence in order to generate the sentence translation.\nA sentence encoder with attention (or self-attentive) BIBREF42 , BIBREF43 , BIBREF44 assigns different weights to the own words of the sentence; therefore, converting the hidden states into a single sentence vector representation.\nConsidering the word hidden vectors set $\\lbrace h_1, \\cdots , h_T\\rbrace $ where $h_t \\in \\mathbb {R}^n$ , the attention mechanism is defined by the equations:\n$$\\tilde{h}_t &= \\sigma \\left(W h_t + b \\right) \\\\ \\alpha _{t} &= \\frac{\\exp ({v^{\\intercal } \\cdot \\tilde{h}_t} )}{\\sum _{t} \\exp ({v \\cdot \\tilde{h}_t})} \\\\ S_{A_w} &= \\sum _{t} \\alpha _{t} h_t$$   (Eq. 66)\nwhere $W \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_a \\times n}$ , $b \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_a \\times 1}$ , and $v \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_a \\times 1}$ are trainable parameters.\nWe can see that the sentence representation $S_{A_w}$ is a weighted average of the hidden states. fig:bilstminneratt provides a schematic view of the BiLSTM attention, where we can account the attention described in eq:att as a two layer model with a dense layer ( $d_a$ units) followed by another dense that predicts $\\alpha _t$ (single unit).\nMethodology\nIn this section, we first introduce our problem in a deep multimodal learning framework. We then present our neural architecture, which is able to address the problems of news relevance and novelty. Finally, we review the methods applied to learn commonalities between stocks (global features).\nProblem statement\nOur problem is to predict the daily stock volatility. As discussed in subsub:rangevolestimators, the Gaman-Klass estimator $\\widehat{\\sigma _{GK,t}}$ in eq:volgk is a very efficient short-term volatility proxy, thus, it is adopted as our target variable.\nOur goal is to learn a mapping between the next day volatility $\\sigma _{t+1}$ and historical multimodal data available up to day $t$ . To this aim, we use a sliding window approach with window size $T$ . That is, for each stock $sc$ a sample on day $t$ is expressed as a sequence of historical prices $P^{sc}_t$ and corpus headlines $N^{sc}_t$ . The price sequence is a vector of Daily Prices (DP) and expressed as\n$$P^{sc}_t = \\left[DP^{sc}_{t-T}, DP^{sc}_{t-T+1}, \\cdots , DP^{sc}_t \\right]$$   (Eq. 69)\nwhere $DP^{sc}_{t^{\\prime }}$ is a vector of price features. In order to avoid task-specific feature engineering, the daily price features are expressed as the simple returns:\n$$DP^{sc}_t = \\left[ \\frac{O^{sc}_{t}}{C^{sc}_{t-1}} - 1, \\frac{H^{sc}_{t}}{C^{sc}_{t-1}} - 1, \\frac{L^{sc}_{t}}{C^{sc}_{t-1}} - 1, \\frac{C^{sc}_{t}}{C^{sc}_{t-1}} - 1 \\right]$$   (Eq. 70)\nThe sequence of historical corpus headlines $N^{sc}_t$ is expressed as\n$$N^{sc}_t = \\left[n^{sc}_{t-T}, n^{sc}_{t-T+1}, \\cdots , n^{sc}_{t} \\right]$$   (Eq. 71)\nwhere $n^{sc}_{t^{\\prime }}$ is a set containing all headlines that influence the market on a given day $t^{\\prime }$ .\nAiming to align prices and news modes, we consider the explicit alignment method discussed in subsec:stockheadlines. That is, $n^{sc}_{t^{\\prime }}$ contains all stock headlines before the market opens ( $\\texttt {before market}_{t}$ ), during the trading hours\n( $\\texttt {during market}_{t}$ ), and previous day after-markets\n( $\\texttt {after market}_{t-1}$ ).\nAs a text preprocessing step, we tokenize the headlines and convert each word to an integer that refers to its respective pre-trained word embedding. This process is described as follows: First, for all stocks of our corpus we tokenize each headline and extract the corpus vocabulary set $V$ . We then build the embedding matrix $E_w \\in \\mathbb {R}^{\\vert V \\vert \\times d_w}$ , where each row is a word embedding vector $d_w$ dimensions. Words that do not have a corresponding embedding, i.e. out of vocabulary words, are skipped.\nFinally, the input sample of the text mode is a tensor of integers with $T \\times l_n \\times l_s$ dimensions, where $l_n$ is the maximum number of news occurring in a given day and $l_s$ is the maximum length of a corpus sentence. Regarding the price mode, we have a $T \\times 4$ tensor of floating numbers.\nGlobal features and stock embedding\nGiven the price and news histories for each stock $sc$ we could directly learn one model per stock. However, this approach suffers from two main drawbacks. First, the market activity of one specific stock is expected to impact other stocks, which is a widely accepted pattern named “spillover effect”. Second, since our price data is sampled on a daily basis, we would train the stock model relying on a small number of samples. One possible solution to model the commonality among stocks would be feature enrichment. For example, when modeling a given stock $X$ we would enrich its news and price features by concatenating features from stock $Y$ and $Z$ . Although the feature enrichment is able to model the effect of other stocks, it still would consider only one sample per day.\nIn this work, we propose a method that learns an global model.\nThe global model is implemented using the following methods:\nMulti-Stock batch samples: Since our models are trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent, we propose at each mini-batch iteration to sample from a batch set containing any stock of our stocks universe. As a consequence, the mapping between volatility and multimodal data is now able to learn common explanatory factors among stocks. Moreover, adopting this approach increases the total number of training samples, which is now the sum of the number of samples per stock.\nStock Embedding: Utilizing the Multi-Stock batch samples above, we tackle the problem of modeling commonality among stocks. However, it is reasonable to assume that stocks have part of its dynamic driven by idiosyncratic factors. Nevertheless, we could aggregate stocks per sector or rely on any measure of similarity among stocks. In order to incorporate information specific to each stock, we propose to equip our model with a “stock embedding” mode that is learnt jointly with price and news modes. That is to say, we leave the task of distinguishing the specific dynamic of each stock to be learnt by the neural network. Specifically, this stock embedding is modeled using a discrete encoding as input, i.e. $\\mathcal {I}^{sc}_t$ is a vector with size equal to the number of stocks of the stocks universe and has element 1 for the i-th coordinate and 0 elsewhere, thus, indicating the stock of each sample.\nFormally, we can express the one model per stock approach as the mapping\n$$\\begin{split} \\sigma ^{sc}_{t+1} = f^{sc} ( DN^{sc}_{t-T}, DN^{sc}_{t-T+1}, \\cdots , DN^{sc}_t ; \\\\ DP^{sc}_{t-T}, DP^{sc}_{t-T+1}, \\cdots , DP^{sc}_t ) \\end{split}$$   (Eq. 75)\nwhere $DN^{sc}_{t^{\\prime }}$ is a fixed-vector representing all news released on a given day for the stock $sc$ and $DP^{sc}_{t^{\\prime }}$ is defined in eq:pricemodevec.\nThe global model attempts to learn a single mapping $f$ that at each mini-batch iteration randomly aggregates samples across all the universe of stocks, rather than one mapping $f^{sc}$ per stock. The global model is expressed as\n$$\\begin{split} \\sigma ^{sc}_{t+1} = f ( DN^{sc}_{t-T}, DN^{sc}_{t-T+1}, \\cdots , DN^{sc}_t ; \\\\ DP^{sc}_{t-T}, DP^{sc}_{t-T+1}, \\cdots , DP^{sc}_t ; \\\\ \\mathcal {I}^{sc}_t) \\end{split}$$   (Eq. 77)\nIn the next section, we describe our hierarchical neural model and how the news, price and stock embedding are fused into a joint representation.\nOur multimodal hierarchical network\nIn broad terms, our hierarchical neural architecture is described as follows. First, each headline released on a given day $t$ is encoded into a fixed-size vector $S_t$ using a sentence encoder. We then apply our daily New Relevance Attention (NRA) mechanism that attends each news based on its content and converts a variable size of news released on a given day into a single vector denoted by Daily News ( $DN$ ). We note that this representation take account of the overall effect of all news released on a given day. This process is illustrated in fig:DNencoder. We now are in a position to consider the temporal effect of the past $T$ days of market news and price features. fig:nntimeseriesarch illustrates the neural network architecture from the temporal sequence to the final volatility prediction. For each stock code $sc$ the temporal encoding for news is denoted by Market News $MN^{sc}_t$ and for the price by Market Price $MP^{sc}_t$ and are a function of the past $T$ Daily News representations ${\\lbrace DN^{sc}_{t-T}, \\cdots , DN^{sc}_t \\rbrace }$ (Text mode) and Daily Prices features $S_t$0 (Price mode), where each Daily Price $S_t$1 feature is given by eq:pricemodevec and the $S_t$2 representation is calculated using Daily New Relevance Attention. After the temporal effects of $S_t$3 past days of market activity were already encoded into the Market News $S_t$4 and Market Price $S_t$5 , we concatenate feature-wise $S_t$6 , $S_t$7 and the Stock embedding $S_t$8 . The stock embedding $S_t$9 represents the stock code of the sample on a given day $t$ . Finally, we have a Fully Connected (FC) layer that learns the Joint Representation of all modes. This fixed-sized joint representation is fed into a FC layer with linear activation that predicts the next day volatility $\\hat{\\sigma }_{t+1}$ .\nBelow, we detail, for each mode separately, the layers of our hierarchical model.\n– Text mode\nWord Embedding Retrieval\nStandard embedding layer with no trainable parameters. It receives a vector of word indices as input and returns a matrix of word embeddings.\nNews Encoder\nThis layer encodes all news on a given day and outputs a set news embeddings $\\lbrace S^{1}_t, \\cdots , S^{l_n}_t \\rbrace $ . Each encoded sentence has dimension $d_S$ , which is a hyperparameter of our model. This layer constitutes a key component of our neural architectures and, as such, we evaluate our models considering sentence encoders trained end-to-end, using the BiLSTM attention (subsec:bilstminneratt) and BiLSTM max-pooling (subsec:bilstmmaxpool) architectures, and also transferred from the RCV1 and SNLI as fixed features.\nDaily news relevance attention\nOur proposed news relevance attention mechanism for all news released on a given day. The attention mechanism is introduced to tackle information overload. It was designed to “filter out” redundant or misleading news and focus on the relevant ones based solely on the news content. Formally, the layer outputs a Daily News (DN) embedding $DN^{sc}_t = \\sum _{i=1}^{l_n} \\beta _i S^{sc^{i}}_t$ , which is a linear combination of all encoded news on a given day $t$ . This news-level attention uses the same equations as in eq:att, but with trainable weights $\\lbrace W_{R}, b_{R}, v_{R}\\rbrace $ , i.e. the weights are segregated from the sentence encoder. fig:DNencoder, illustrates our relevance attention. Note that this layer was deliberately developed to be invariant to headlines permutation, as is the case with the linear combination formula above. The reason is that our price data is sampled daily and, as a consequence, we are not able to discriminate the market reaction for each intraday news.\nNews Temporal Context\nSequence layer with daily news embeddings $DN^{sc}_t$ as time steps. This layer aims to learn the temporal context of news, i.e. the relationship between the news at day $t$ and the $T$ past days. It receives as input a chronologically ordered sequence of $T$ past Daily News embeddings ${\\lbrace DN^{sc}_{t-T}, \\cdots , DN^{sc}_t \\rbrace }$ and outputs the news mode encoding Market News $MN^{sc}_t \\in d_{MN}$ . The sequence with $T$ time steps is encoded using a BiLSTM attention. The layer was designed to capture the temporal order that news are released and the current news novelty. i.e. news that were repeated in the past can be “forgotten” based on the modulating gates of the LSTM network.\n– Price mode\nPrice Encoder\nSequence layer analogous to News Temporal Context, but for the price mode. The input is the ordered sequence Daily Prices ${\\lbrace DP^{sc}_{t-T}, \\cdots , DP^{sc}_t \\rbrace }$ of size $T$ , where each element the price feature defined in eq:pricemodevec. Particularly, the architecture consists of two stacked LSTM's. The first one outputs for each price feature time step a hidden vector that takes the temporal context into account. Then these hidden vectors are again passed to a second independent LSTM. The layer outputs the price mode encoding Market Price $MP^{sc}_t \\in d_{MP}$ . This encoding is the last hidden vector of the second LSTM Market.\n– Stock embedding\nStock Encoder\nStock dense representation. The layer receives the discrete encoding $\\mathcal {I}^{sc}_t$ indicating the sample stock code pass through a FC layer and outputs a stock embedding $E_{sc}$ .\n– Joint Representation\nMerging\nFeature-wise News, Price, and Stock modes concatenation. No trainable parameters.\nJoint Representation Encoder\nFC layer of size $d_{JR}$ .\nMultimodal learning with missing modes\nDuring the training we feed into our neural model the price, news, and stock indicator data. The price and stock indicator modes data occur in all days. However, at the individual stock level we can have days that the company is not covered by the media. This feature imposes challenges to our multimodal training since neural networks are not able to handle missing modes without special intervention. A straightforward solution would be to consider only days with news released, disregarding the remaining samples. However, this approach has two main drawbacks. First, the “missing news” do not happen at random, or are attributed to measurement failure as is, for example, the case of multimodal tasks using mechanical sensors data. Conversely, as highlighted in BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 the same price behaviour results in distinct market reactions when accompanied or not by news. In other words, specifically to financial forecasting problems the absence or existence of news are highly informative.\nSome methods were proposed in the multimodal literature to effectively treat informative missing modes or “informative missingness”, which is a characteristic refereed in the literature as learning with missing modalities BIBREF22 . In this work, we directly model the news missingness as a feature of our text model temporal sequence by using the method initially proposed in BIBREF45 , BIBREF46 for clinical data with missing measurements and applied in the context of financial forecasting in BIBREF47 . Specifically, we implement the Zeros & Imputation (ZI) method BIBREF46 in order to jointly learn the price mode and news relationship across all days of market activity.\nThe ZI implementation is described as follows: Before the daily news sequence is processed by the text temporal layer (described in itm:newstclayer) we input a 0 vector for all time steps with missing news and leave the news encoding unchanged otherwise. This step is called zero imputation. In addition, we concatenate feature-wise an indicator vector with value 1 for all vectors with zero imputation and 0 for the days with news.\nAs described in BIBREF47 , the ZI method endow a temporal sequence model with the ability to learn different representations depending on the news history and its relative time position. Moreover, it allows our model to predict the volatility for all days of our time series and, at the same time, take into account the current and past news informative missingness. Furthermore, the learnt positional news encoding works differently than a typical “masking”, where days without news are not passed through the LSTM cell. Masking the time steps would be losing information about the presence or absence of news concomitant with prices.\nExperimental results and discussions\nWe aim to evaluate our hierarchical neural model in the light of three main aspects. First, we asses the importance of the different sentence encoders to our end-to-end models and how it compares to transferring the sentence encoder from our two auxiliary TL tasks. Second, we ablate our proposed news relevance attention (NRA) component to evaluate its importance. Finally, we consider a model that takes into consideration only the price mode (unimodal), i.e. ignoring any architecture related to the text mode.\nBefore we define the baselines to asses the three aspects described above, we review in the next section the scores of the trained TL tasks.\nAuxiliary transfer learning tasks\nThis section reports the performance of the auxiliary TL tasks considered in this work. Our ultimate goal is to indicate that our scores are in line with previous works All the architectures presented in sec:transferlearning are trained for a maximum of 50 epochs using mini-batch SGD with Adam optimizer BIBREF48 . Moreover, at the end of each epoch, we evaluate the validation scores, which are accuracy (Stanfor SNLI dataset) and F1 (RCV1 dataset), and save the weights with the best values. Aiming to seeped up training, we implement early stopping with patience set to 8 epochs. That is, if the validation scores do not improve for more than 10 epochs we halt the training. Finally, we use Glove pre-trained word embeddings BIBREF37 as fixed features.\ntbl:tlevaluation compares our test scores with state-of-the-art (SOTA) results reported in previous works. We can see that our scores for the SNLI task are very close to state-of-the-art.\nRegarding the RCV1 dataset, our results consider only the headline content for training, while the refereed works consider both the news headline and message body. The reason for training using only the headlines is that both tasks are learnt with the sole purpose of transferring the sentence encoders to our main volatility prediction task, whose textual input is restricted to headlines.\nTraining setup\nDuring the training of our hierarchical neural model described in sub:HAN we took special care to guard against overfitting. To this aim, we completely separate 2016 and 2017 as the test set and report our results on this “unseen” set. The remaining data is further split into training (2007 to 2013) and validation (2014 to 2015). The model convergence during training is monitored in the validation set. We monitor the validation score of our model at the end of each epoch and store the network weights if the validation scores improves between two consecutive epochs. Additionally, we use mini-batch SGD with Adam optimizer and early stopping with patience set to eight epochs. The hyperparameter tunning is performed using grid search.\nAll training is performed using the proposed global model approach described in sub:globalmodel, which learns a model that takes into account the features of all the 40 stocks of our corpus. Using this approach our training set has a total of 97,903 samples. Moreover, during the SGD mini-batch sampling the past $T$ days of price and news history tensors and each stock sample stock indicator are randomly selected from the set of all 40 stocks.\nStocks universe result\nIn order to evaluate the contributions of each component of our neural model described in sub:HAN and the effect of using textual data to predict the volatility, we report our results using the following baselines:\n- News (unimodal price only): This baseline completely ablates (i.e. removes) any architecture related to the news mode, considering only the price encoding and the stock embedding components. Using this ablation we aim to evaluate the influence of news to the volatility prediction problem.\n+ News (End-to-end Sentence Encoders) - NRA: This baseline ablates our proposed new relevance attention (NRA) component, and instead, makes use of the same Daily Averaging method in BIBREF26 , BIBREF27 , where all fixed-sized headline representations on a given day are averaged without taking into account the relevance of each news. We evaluate this baseline for both BiLSTM attention (Att) and BiLSTM max-pooling (MP) sentence encoders. Here, our goal is to asses the true contribution of our NRA component in the case SOTA sentence encoders are taken into account.\n+ News (End-to-End W-L Att Sentence Encoder) + NRA: The Word-Level Attention (W-L Att) sentence encoder implements an attention mechanism directly on top of word embeddings, and, as such, does not consider the order of words in a sentence. This baseline complements the previous one, i.e. it evaluates the influence of the sentence encoder when our full specification is considered.\n+ News (TL Sentence Encoders) + NRA: Makes use of sentence encoders of our two auxiliary TL tasks as fixed features. This baseline aims to address the following questions, namely: What dataset and models are more suitable to transfer to our specific volatility forecasting problem; How End-to-End models, which are trained on top of word embeddings, perform compared to sentence encoders transferred from other tasks.\ntbl:comparativeallsectors summarizes the test scores for the ablations discussed above. Our best model is the + News (BiLSTM Att) + NRA, which is trained end-to-end and uses our full architecture. The second best model, i.e. + News (BiLSTM MP) + NRA, ranks slightly lower and only differs form the best model in terms of the sentence encoder. The former sentence encoder uses an attention layer (subsec:bilstminneratt) and the the last a max-pooling layer (subsec:bilstmmaxpool), where both layers are placed on top of the LSTM hidden states of each word.\nImportantly, our experiments show that using news and price (multimodal) to predict the volatility improves the scores by 11% (MSE) and 9% (MAE) when compared with the – News (price only unimodal) model that considers only price features as explanatory variables.\nWhen comparing the performance of End-to-End models and the TL auxiliary tasks the following can be observed: The end-to-end models trained with the two SOTA sentence encoders perform better than transferring sentence encoder from both auxiliary tasks. However, our experiments show that the same does not hold for models trained end-to-end relying on the simpler WL-Att sentence encoder, which ignores the order of words in a sentence. In other words, considering the appropriate TL task, it is preferable to transfer a SOTA sentence encoder trained on a larger dataset than learning a less robust sentence encoder in an end-to-end fashion. Moreover, initially, we thought that being the RCV1 a financial domain corpus it would demonstrate a superior performance when compared to the SNLI dataset. Still, the SNLI transfers better than RCV1. We hypothesize that the text categorization task (RCV1 dataset) is not able to capture complex sentence structures at the same level required to perform natural language inference. Particularly to the volatility forecasting problem, our TL results corroborates the same findings in BIBREF17 , where it was shown that SNLI dataset attains the best sentence encoding for a broad range of pure NLP tasks, including, among other, text categorization and sentiment analysis.\nSignificantly, experimental results in tbl:comparativeallsectors clearly demonstrate that our proposed news relevance attention (NRA) outperforms the News Averaging method proposed in previous studies BIBREF26 , BIBREF27 . Even when evaluating our NRA component in conjunction with the more elementary W-L Att sentence encoder it surpass the results of sophisticated sentence encoder using a News Averaging approach. In other words, our results strongly points to the advantage of discriminating noisy from impacting news and the effectiveness of learning to attend the most relevant news.\nHaving analyzed our best model, we now turn to its comparative performance with respect to the widely regarded GARCH(1,1) model described in sec:GARCH.\nWe asses our model performance relative to GARCH(1,1) using standard loss metrics (MSE and MAE) and the regression-based accuracy specified in eq:regressionloss and measured in terms of the coefficient of determination $R^2$ . In addition, we evaluate our model across two different volatility proxies: Garman-Klass ( $\\widehat{\\sigma _{GK}}$ ) (eq:volgk) and Parkinson ( $\\widehat{\\sigma _{PK}}$ ) (eq:volpk). We note that, as reviewed in sub:evalution, these two volatility proxies are statically efficient and proper estimators of the next day volatility.\ntbl:garchallsectors reports the comparative performance among our best Price + News model (+ News BiLSTM (MP) + NRA), our Price only (unimodal) model and GARCH(1,1). The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our model, being more accurate than GRACH for both volatility proxies. We note that evaluating the GARCH(1,1) model relying on standard MSE and MAE error metrics should be taken with a grain of salt. BIBREF35 provides the background theory and arguments supporting $R^2$ as the metric of choice to evaluate the predictive power of a volatility model. In any case, the outperformance or our model with respect to GARCH(1,1) permeates all three metrics, name $R^2$ , $MSE$ and $MAE$ .\nSector-level results\nCompany sectors are expected to have different risk levels, in the sense that each sector is driven by different types of news and economic cycles. Moreover, by performing a sector-level analysis we were initially interested in understanding if the outperformance of our model with respect to GARCH(1,1) was the result of a learning bias to a given sector or if, as turned out to be the case, the superior performance of our model spreads across a diversified portfolio of sectors.\nIn order to evaluate the performance per sector, we first separate the constituents stocks for each sector in tbl:stockuniverse. Then, we calculate the same metrics discussed in the previous section for each sector individually.\ntbl:garcheachsector reports our experimental results segregated by sector. We observe that the GRACH model accuracy, measured using the $R^2$ score, has a high degree of variability among sectors. For example, the accuracy ranges from 0.15 to 0.44 for the HealthCare and Energy sector, respectively. This high degree of variability is in agreement with previous results reported in BIBREF16 , but in the context of long-term (quarterly) volatility predictions. Although the GARCH(1,1) accuracy is sector-dependent, without any exception, our model using price and news as input clearly outperforms GRACH sector-wise. This fact allow us to draw the following conclusions:\nOur model outperformance is persistent across sectors, i.e. the characteristics of the results reported in tbl:garchallsectors permeates all sectors, rather than being composed of a mix of outperforming and underperforming sector contributions. This fact provides a strong evidence that our model is more accurate than GARCH(1,1).\nThe proposed Global model approach discussed in sub:globalmodel is able to generalize well, i.e. the patterns learnt are not biased to a given sector or stock.\nOne of the limitations of our work is to rely on proxies for the volatility estimation. Although these proxies are handy if only open, high, low and close daily price data is available, having high frequency price data we could estimate the daily volatility using the sum of squared intraday returns to measure the true daily latent volatility. For example, in evaluating the performance for the one-day-ahead GARCH(1,1) Yen/Dollar exchange rate BIBREF35 reports $R^2$ values of 0.237 and 0.392 using hourly and five minutes sampled intraday returns, respectively. However, we believe that utilizing intraday data would further improve our model performance.\nSince our experimental results demonstrate the key aspect of the news relevance attention to model architecture we observe that intraday data would arguably ameliorate the learning process. Having intraday data would allow us to pair each individual news release with the instantaneous market price reaction. Using daily data we are losing part of this information by only measuring the aggregate effect of all news to the one-day-ahead prediction.\nConclusion\nWe study the joint effect of stock news and prices on the daily volatility forecasting problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first studies aiming to predict short-term (daily) rather than long-term (quarterly or yearly) volatility taking news and price as explanatory variables and using a comprehensive dataset of news headlines at the individual stock level. Our hierarchical end-to-end model benefits from state-of-the-art approaches to encode text information and to deal with two main challenges in correlating news with market reaction: news relevance and novelty. That is, to address the problem of how to attend the most important news based purely on its content (news relevance attention) and to take into account the temporal information of past news (temporal context). Additionally, we propose a multi-stock mini-batch + stock embedding method suitable to model commonality among stocks.\nThe experimental results show that our multimodal approach outperforms the GARCH(1,1) volatility model, which is the most prevalent econometric model for daily volatility predictions. The outperformance being sector-wise and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining price and news for short-term volatility forecasting. The fact that we outperform GARCH(1,1) for all analyzed sectors confirms the robustness of our proposed architecture and evidences that our global model approach generalizes well.\nWe ablated (i.e. removed) different components of our neural architecture to assess its most relevant parts. To this aim, we replaced our proposed news relevance attention layer, which aims to attend the most important news on a given day, with a simpler architecture proposed in the literature, which averages the daily news. We found that our attention layer improves the results. Additionally, we ablated all the architecture related to the news mode and found that news enhances the forecasting accuracy.\nFinally, we evaluated different sentence encoders, including those transfered from other NLP tasks, and concluded that they achieve better performance as compared to a plain Word-level attention sentence encoder trained end-to-end. However, they do not beat state-of-the-art sentence encoders trained end-to-end.\nIn order to contribute to the literature of Universal Sentence Encoders, we evaluated the performance of transferring sentence encoders from two different tasks to the volatility prediction problem. We showed that models trained on the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task are more suitable to forecasting problems than a financial domain dataset (Reuters RCV1). By analyzing different architectures, we showed that a BiLSTM with max-pooling for the SNLI dataset provides the best sentence encoder.\nIn the future, we plan to make use of intraday prices to better assess the predictive power of our proposed models. Additionally, we would further extend our analysis to other stock market sectors.", "answers": ["Energy with accuracy of 0.538", "Energy"], "length": 10349, "dataset": "qasper", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c47ca982b6c4681c4741d4708801fa79a3e1cab17d0a2c4a"}
{"input": "Which film has the director who was born earlier, The Secret Invasion or The House Of The Seven Hawks?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Secret Invasion\nThe Secret Invasion is a 1964 American war film directed by Roger Corman. It stars Stewart Granger, Raf Vallone, Mickey Rooney, Edd Byrnes, Henry Silva, Mia Massini, and William Campbell. Appearing three years before The Dirty Dozen (1967), the film features a similar World War II mission where convicts are recruited by the Allies for an extremely hazardous operation behind enemy lines.\n\nPlot\nIn 1943, British Intelligence in Cairo recruits Italian  criminal mastermind Roberto Rocca, demolitions expert and Irish Republican Army member Terence Scanlon, forger Simon Fell, cold-blooded assassin John Durrell, and thief and impersonator Jean Saval for a dangerous mission. The men are offered pardons in exchange for attempting to rescue an Italian general sympathetic to the Allies who is imprisoned in German-occupied Yugoslavia. The group is led by Major Richard Mace, who is trying to expiate his feelings of guilt for sending his own brother on a dangerous mission and waiting too long to extricate him. The fishing boat transporting Mace's team is stopped by a patrol boat, but they dispose of the Germans.\nWith the assistance of local partisans led by Marko, they split up and enter Dubrovnik. Durrell is partnered with Mila, a recent widow with a baby. They are attracted to each other, but Durrell becomes extremely distraught when he accidentally smothers her crying child to avoid detection by a German patrol. The team is captured and taken to the same fortress where the Italian general is being kept. They are tortured for information, but manage to escape and fulfill their mission, although Mace, Mila, Fell, Scanlon, and Saval are killed while fending off German troops.\nAt the last minute, Rocca and Durrell discover that the man they have freed is an impostor, and he is about to exhort \"his\" troops to stay loyal to the Axis. Durrell pretends to be a Nazi fanatic and shoots the fake general; he is killed by the outraged Italians. Rocca, the last man standing, directs the Italians' anger to the Germans.\n\nCast\nProduction\nAfter turning out a treatment based on the locale of Dubrovnik, Roger Corman teamed with screenwriter R. Wright Campbell who had a project, Dubious Patriots about a wartime mission involving convicts. The script was taken over by producer David V. Picker at United Artists, who was able to leverage the screenplay into a well-financed studio production. With a budget of $600,000, more than twice more than he had for his earlier independently-funded features, Corman was able to start production in between his Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, The Masque of the Red Death and The Tomb of Ligeia (1964).The original cast was Mickey Rooney, Raf Vallone, Edd Byrnes and Bobby Darin. Brendan Behan was to be adviser for scenes set at Borstal Prison. It was Byrnes first role after his contract with Warner Bros ended.In August 1963 it was announced that Darin had pulled out of the film on the orders of his doctor, and he was replaced by Henry Silva. Also that month Stewart Granger signed to star.Principal photography under the working title of Dubious Patriots took place on location in Dubrovnik and other parts of Yugoslavia in the summer of 1963 for a typically short Corman shooting schedule of 36 days. With the assistance of the Yugoslavian government, a large number of military personnel and equipment were offered, but an earthquake threatened to delay the production when troops were siphoned off to help in the relief effort.Corman's problems extended to not only wrangling military extras, but also to dealing with the emotions of a star like Stewart Granger \"stooping\" to make a \"B film\" and worrying that his role was not as prominent as the others in the ensemble cast. At one point, Corman actually rewrote his part \"on the spot\" so that Granger had more lines than Edd Byrnes, his co-star, who was a current popular television star.The production was photographed in Panavision with Eastmancolor film.(Gene Corman later reused the title The Dubious Patriots for another film he made with Tony Curtis and Charles Bronson.)\n\nReception\nIn a contemporary review of The Secret Invasion, The New York Times film reviewer Howard Thompson saw some positives in what was basically a \"programmer\": \n\n... a rather surprising amount of brisk muscularity and panoramic color, if not always credibility. The casting of this United Artists release, which arrived at the Criterion and other houses, may make some customers blink and wait for the worst ... But they, and the picture, do pretty well, considering.\n\nIn Brassey's Guide to War Films, film historian Alun Evans considered the production exemplified Corman's ability to \"... create something out of nothing.\" He also noted that The Secret Invasion has some notoriety as  \"... the  sawn-off antecedent of The Dirty Dozen.\"\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1964\nFive Guns West, an earlier Roger Corman movie of essentially the same plot\nPassage 2:\nRyoichi Hattori (politician)\nRyoichi Hattori (服部良一, Hattori Ryoichi, born February 24, 1950) is a Japanese politician of the Social Democratic Party. He was born in Yame city in Fukuoka prefecture. He entered Kyoto University in 1969 before leaving part-way through his degree and moving to Osaka to work, where he became active with the trade union movement.\nIn the House of Councillors 2007 election he ran for the House of Councillors in Osaka, but was defeated. He became the private secretary of Tokushin Yamauchi, an SDP member of the House of Councillors.\nIn the 2009 general election he was elected as the House of Representatives member representing the Kinki block.\nPassage 3:\nEdward Yates\nEdward J. Yates (September 16, 1918 – June 2, 2006) was an American television director who was the director of the ABC television program American Bandstand from 1952 until 1969.\n\nBiography\nYates became a still photographer after graduating from high school in 1936. After serving in World War II, he became employed by Philadelphia's WFIL-TV as a boom microphone operator. He was later promoted to cameraman (important as most programming was done live and local during the early years of television) and earned a bachelor's degree in communications in 1950 from the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn October 1952, Yates volunteered to direct Bandstand, a new concept featuring local teens dancing to the latest hits patterned after the \"950 Club\" on WPEN-AM. The show debuted with Bob Horn as host and took off after Dick Clark, already a radio veteran at age 26, took over in 1956.\nIt was broadcast live in its early years, even after it became part of the ABC network's weekday afternoon lineup in 1957 as American Bandstand. Yates pulled records, directed the cameras, queued the commercials and communicated with Clark via a private line telephone located on his podium.\nIn 1964, Clark moved the show to Los Angeles, taking Yates with him.\nYates retired from American Bandstand in 1969, and moved his family to the Philadelphia suburb of West Chester.\nHe died in 2006 at a nursing home where he had been for the last two months of his life.\n\nExternal links\nEdward Yates at IMDb\nPassage 4:\nBen Palmer\nBen Palmer (born 1976) is a British film and television director.\nHis television credits include the Channel 4 sketch show Bo' Selecta!

Known under various monikers such as \"The Pope of Pop Cinema\", \"The Spiritual Godfather of the New Hollywood\", and \"The King of Cult\", he is known as a trailblazer in the world of independent film. Many of Corman's films are based on works that have an already-established critical reputation, such as his cycle of low-budget cult films adapted from the tales of Edgar Allan Poe.In 1964, Corman—admired by members of the French New Wave and Cahiers du Cinéma—became the youngest filmmaker to have a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, as well as in the British Film Institute and the Museum of Modern Art. He was the co-founder of New World Pictures, the founder of New Concorde and is a longtime member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2009, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award \"for his rich engendering of films and filmmakers\".Corman is also famous for distributing in the U.S. many foreign directors, such as Federico Fellini (Italy), Ingmar Bergman (Sweden), François Truffaut (France) and Akira Kurosawa (Japan). He mentored and gave a start to many young film directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante, John Sayles, and James Cameron, and was highly influential in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He also helped to launch the careers of actors like Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern, Diane Ladd, and William Shatner. Corman has occasionally taken minor acting roles in the films of directors who started with him, including The Silence of the Lambs, The Godfather Part II, Apollo 13, The Manchurian Candidate, and Philadelphia.A documentary about Corman's life and career entitled Corman's World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel, directed by Alex Stapleton, premiered at the Sundance and Cannes Film Festivals in 2011. The film's TV rights were picked up by A&E IndieFilms after a well-received screening at Sundance.\n\nEarly life\nCorman was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Anne (née High) and William Corman, an engineer. His younger brother, Gene, produced numerous films, sometimes in collaboration with Roger. Corman and his brother were raised Catholic.Corman went to Beverly Hills High School and then to Stanford University to study industrial engineering. While at Stanford, Corman realized he did not want to be an engineer. He enlisted in the V-12 Navy College Training Program with six months of study to complete. After serving in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946, he returned to Stanford to finish his degree, receiving a Bachelor of Science in industrial engineering in 1947. While at Stanford University, Corman was initiated in the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon.\nIn 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on Slauson Avenue in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss \"I've made a terrible mistake.\" Gene Corman was already working in the film industry as an agent, and Roger decided to go into filmmaking instead.\n\nEarly film career\nCorman found work at 20th Century Fox initially in the mail room. He worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as The Gunfighter with Gregory Peck. When Corman received no credit at all, he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the G.I. Bill, Corman studied English literature at Oxford University and lived in Paris for a time.\n\nHe then returned to Los Angeles and tried to re-establish himself in the film industry. He took various jobs, including television stagehand at KLAC and a messenger at Fox. He worked as an assistant to agent Dick Hyland, a literary agent.\n\nHighway Dragnet\nCorman wrote a script in his spare time and sold it to William F. Broidy at Allied Artists for $2,000. \"Dick thought it was funny and let me pay myself a commission,\" said Corman. Originally called House in the Sea, it was retitled Highway Dragnet (1953) and starred Richard Conte and Joan Bennett. Corman also worked as associate producer on the film for nothing, just for the experience.\n\nProducer\nCorman used his script fee and personal contacts to raise $12,000 to produce his first feature, a science-fiction film, Monster from the Ocean Floor (1954). It was produced by Corman's own company, Palo Alto, and released by Robert L. Lippert.\nThe film did well enough to encourage Corman to produce another film, the racing-car thriller The Fast and the Furious (1955), directed by its star, John Ireland, and co-starring Dorothy Malone. Decades later, producer Neal H. Moritz and Universal Pictures licensed the title for the 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious, which eventually spawned a huge franchise. Moritz had difficulty choosing between proposed titles Racer X, Redline, Race Wars, and Street Wars, and was inspired by a documentary on American International Pictures that included Corman's film. Moritz was able to trade the use of some stock footage to Corman for use of the title.Corman sold the movie to a new independent company, the American Releasing Company (ARC), run by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff. Although Corman had a number of offers for the film from Republic and Columbia, he elected to go with ARC because they undertook to advance money to enable him to make two more movies.\n\nDirector\nCorman's second film for ARC was one he decided to direct, Five Guns West (1955), a Western, made in color for around $60,000, with Malone and John Lund. The script was written by Robert Wright Campbell, who worked with Corman on several more occasions.\nCorman announced he would make four more projects for ARC: High Steel, Cobra, Fortress Beneath the Sea, and an untitled film from Campbell. Instead, Corman did some uncredited directing on The Beast with a Million Eyes (1955), then made another Western, Apache Woman (1955), starring Lloyd Bridges, written by Lou Rusoff. Rusoff and Corman reunited on Day the World Ended (1955), a postapocalyptic science-fiction film, which was popular.\nCorman was to make The Devil on Horseback by Charles B. Griffith about the Brownsville Raid, but it was too expensive.\nThe Woolner Brothers, Louisiana drive-in owners, financed Corman's Swamp Women (1956), a girls-on-the-lam saga.\nHe returned to ARC for two Westerns, The Oklahoma Woman (1956) and Gunslinger (1956) (with Ireland); Gunslinger was co-written by Griffith, who became a crucial collaborator with Corman over the next five years. He bought a script from Curtis Harrington, The Girl from Beneath the Sea. Harrington made it for Corman years later as Night Tide (1961).\nBeverly Garland, one of Corman's early regular stock players, recalled working with him:\n\nRoger made us work hard and long, I remember that! He was always fascinating to me, a fascinating man – and a good businessman! He had such incredible energy, it was tremendous – he was a dynamo to be around. I always knew he was going to be a huge success because there was no stopping him. He just made up his mind that he was going to be a success and that was it.\n\nAmerican International Pictures and Allied Artists\nARC changed its name to American International Pictures. Corman was established as their leading filmmaker. They financed Corman's next film as director, the science-fiction story It Conquered the World (1956). Co-written by Griffith, it was a follow-up to The Day the World Ended. It was a big hit.\nHe optioned a TV play, The Stake, and hoped to get Dana Andrews to star. It was never made. Instead, Walter Mirisch of Allied Artists hired Corman to make The Undead (1957), inspired by The Search for Bridey Murphy. Griffith wrote the script.\nIn June, Corman made a science-fiction film for Allied Artists,  Not of this Earth (1957), written by Griffith.\nIn August 1956, AIP financed a Corman heist movie shot in Hawaii, Naked Paradise (1957), co-written by Griffith. Corman shot it back-to-back with a movie made with his own money, She Gods of Shark Reef (1958). Corman wound up selling the movie to AIP.\nCorman and Griffith reunited in Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957) for Allied, which wound up being one of his most successful early films.For his own production company, Corman made a rock-and-roll \"quickle\", Carnival Rock (1957), released by Howco. Rock All Night (1957) was a heist film written by Griffith expanded from a TV play, \"The Little Guy\", with musical acts inserted.He was meant to make Rock'n'Roll Girl for AIP in December 1957.In April 1957, Corman announced he would try to make two films back-to-back from then on to save costs.Corman made two \"teen girl noirs\", Teenage Doll (1957) for the Woolner Brothers and Sorority Girl (1957), starring Susan Cabot for AIP.For AIP, he made The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent (1957), shot in August 1957. He was meant to follow this with Teenage Jungle by Tony Miller.The success of Not of this Earth and Crab Monsters led to Allied offering Corman a four-picture deal for 1958.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly and producing\nCorman received his first serious critical praise for Machine-Gun Kelly (1958), an AIP biopic of the famous gangster, which gave Charles Bronson his first leading role and co-starred Cabot. Campbell wrote the script.\nAlso for AIP, he did Teenage Caveman (1958), with Robert Vaughn, originally titled Prehistoric World.\nHe helped produce two films for Allied Artists, both from scripts by Leo Gordon: Hot Car Girl (1958), directed by Bernard Kowalski and produced by his brother Gene (the first film they made together) from a script by Gordon; and The Cry Baby Killer (1958), which gave Jack Nicholson his first starring role.\nHe had his biggest budget yet for I Mobster (1958), a gangster story, co-produced by Edward L. Alperson and Corman's brother Gene for 20th Century Fox. In September 1958, he was reported as scouting locations in Australia to do a remake of H. Rider Haggard's She.War of the Satellites (1958) was conceived and shot in record time to take advantage of the Sputnik launch; it was his first collaboration with art director Daniel Haller.\nCorman also produced, but did not direct, Stakeout on Dope Street (1958), directed by Irvin Kershner, Night of the Blood Beast (1958), directed by Kowalski for AIP, using leftover costumes from Teenage Caveman, and Crime and Punishment U.S.A. (1959), directed by Dennis Sanders with George Hamilton in his first lead role.\n\nThe Filmgroup\nIn January 1959, Corman announced he would be moving into distribution.In 1959, Corman founded The Filmgroup with his brother Gene, a company producing or releasing low-budget black-and-white films as double features for drive-ins and action houses. In February 1959, Filmgroup announced they would release 10 films. Their first movies were High School Big Shot (1959) and T-Bird Gang (1959) produced by Stanley Bickman.\n\nFor AIP, Corman and Griffith made a black comedy, A Bucket of Blood (1959). Corman announced he would follow it with a similar comedy, The Bloodshot Private Eye. It does not seem to have been made. Instead, Griffith reused the same script structure and Corman employed many of the same cast in The Little Shop of Horrors (1960). This film was reputedly shot in two days and one night.For Filmgroup, Corman directed The Wasp Woman (1959), starring Cabot from a script by Gordon. His brother and he made two films back-to-back in South Dakota: Ski Troop Attack (1960), a war movie written by Griffith and directed by Corman, and Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), the first film directed by Monte Hellman.\nCorman went to Puerto Rico and produced another two films back-to-back: Battle of Blood Island (1960), directed by Joel Rapp, and Last Woman on Earth (1960), directed by Corman from a script by Robert Towne. Filming on these two films went so quickly that Corman commissioned Griffith to write a third, which was shot at the same time: Creature from the Haunted Sea (1961).\nCorman was going to make Part Time Mother from a script by Griffith but it appears to have never been made.\n\nHouse of Usher\nAIP wanted Corman to make two horror films for them, in black and white, at under $100,000 each on a 10-day shooting schedule. Corman, however, was tired of making films on this sort of budget and was worried the market for them was in decline. He proposed making a film in colour for $200,000, shot over 15 days. Corman proposed an adaptation of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" by Edgar Allan Poe and AIP agreed. The film was announced in May 1959.Richard Matheson was hired to do the adaptation and Vincent Price was brought in to star; Haller did the art direction. The resulting film, House of Usher (1960), shot in early 1960, was a critical and commercial hit.\nFollowing this, Corman bought two scripts, Sob Sisters Don't Cry and Cop Killer. In March 1960, Corman announced that Filmgroup would be part of an international production group, Compass Productions. He directed a peplum in Greece, Atlas (1961) in August.\nHe was going to direct a thriller from a script by Robert Towne, I Flew a Spy Plane Over Russia. It was not made; neither were two comedies he was to make with Dick Miller and Jon Haze, Murder at the Convention and Pan and the Satyrs.House of Usher had been so successful that AIP wanted a follow-up, and Corman, Haller, Matheson and Price reunited on The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). It was another sizeable hit, and the \"Poe cycle\" of films was underway.\nCorman hired Charles Beaumont to write Masque of the Red Death and announced two films, Captain Nemo and the Floating City and House of Secrets.\n\nThe Intruder\nFollowing The Pit and the Pendulum, Corman directed one of William Shatner's earliest appearances in a lead role with The Intruder (a.k.a. The Stranger, 1962). Based on a novel by Charles Beaumont, the film was co-produced by Gene Corman and was shot in July and August 1961. It took a while for the film to be released and it lost money.Corman was unhappy with his profit participation on the first two Poe films, so he made a third adaptation for different producers, The Premature Burial (1962), written by Charles Beaumont and starring Ray Milland. The film was co-financed by Pathe labs; AIP put pressure on Pathe and ended up buying out their interest.\nFor producer Edward Small, Corman made a historical horror piece about Richard III, Tower of London (1962), starring Vincent Price.  It was meant to be the first in a three-picture deal with Small, but Corman did not enjoy working with the producer.\nFor Filmgroup, he also bought the rights to a Soviet science-fiction film, Nebo Zovyot (1959) and had some additional footage shot for it by his then-assistant, Francis Ford Coppola; the result was Battle Beyond the Sun (1962). He also released The Magic Voyage of Sinbad (1962), dubbed from a Soviet film.\nThe fourth Poe was an anthology, Tales of Terror (1962), shot in late 1961. One of the installments, \"The Black Cat\", was a comedy, inspiring Corman to do a whole Poe story comedically next: The Raven (1963). Later, Corman used the sets for that film for The Terror (1963), made for Filmgroup but released by AIP, and starring Boris Karloff (whose scenes were all shot in two days) and Jack Nicholson. Corman did not direct all of this film; additional scenes were shot by Monte Hellman, Coppola, and Jack Hill, among others.\nThe Young Racers (1963) was produced and directed by Corman in Europe for AIP, starring and written by Campbell. Working on the film was Francis Ford Coppola, whom Corman financed to make his directorial debut, Dementia 13 (1963).\nBack in the U.S., Corman made X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes (1963), a contemporary science-fiction film for AIP starring Ray Milland. He followed it with The Haunted Palace (1963), ostensibly part of the Poe cycle—it featured Price and was made for AIP, written by Beaumont—but was actually based on a story by H. P. Lovecraft.\nCorman directed a war film in Yugoslavia with his brother, The Secret Invasion (1964), with Stewart Granger and Mickey Rooney, from a script by Campbell. Following this, he announced he would make The Life of Robert E. Lee as part of a four-picture deal with Filmgroup worth $3.75 million. Other movies were Fun and Profit by Joel Rapp, The Wild Surfers by John Lamb, and Planet of Storms by Jack Hill. None of these films was made, nor was The Gold Bug, a Poe adaptation written by Griffith.\n\nEnd of the Poe cycle and filming in Europe\nCorman made two Poes in England starring Price, the much-delayed The Masque of the Red Death (1964), with Campbell rewriting Beaumont's scripts, and The Tomb of Ligeia (1965), from a script by Robert Towne. Corman made no further Poes; AIP started up a fresh Poe cycle in the late 1960s, but Corman was not part of it.\nCorman got Towne to write a script called The Red Baron. He bought the rights to another Soviet science-fiction film, Planeta Bur (1962), and had some additional footage added to it by Curtis Harrington. The result was Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965). Harrington used footage from Planeta Bur in another film financed by Corman, Queen of Blood (1966).\nHe also bought the rights to a Yugoslavian film, Operation Titan (1963), and financed additional shooting by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman. The result was Blood Bath (1966). He also had an investment in the beach party films Beach Ball (1965) and It's a Bikini World (1967).\n\nWorking for major studios\nCorman said, \"For ten years as an independent I could get financing for $100-$200-$300,000 pictures. Everything had been interesting, artistically satisfying, economically satisfying. But I decided I was going nowhere and wanted to move directly into the business. So I accepted a contract with Columbia.\"In August 1965, Corman announced he had signed a contract with United Artists to make two films over three years. He also signed with Columbia to make a Western, The Long Ride Home, based on a script by Robert Towne.He was announced for a number of other projects at Columbia: the biopic of Robert E. Lee, an adaptation of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, an adaptation of Kafka's The Penal Colony, and a script by novelist Richard Yates about the Battle of Iwo Jima. He intended to make The Deserters for UA, from a script by Wright, but that was not made either.He later reflected, \"Every idea I submitted was considered too strange, too weird; every idea they had seemed too ordinary to me. Ordinary pictures don't make money.\"\n\nThe Wild Angels\nAfter a year of not directing, Corman took a leave of absence under his contract with Columbia to make a film for AIP, the first biker movie, The Wild Angels. It starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra, from a script by Griffith; Peter Bogdanovich worked as Corman's assistant. The film opened the 1966 Venice Film Festival and was hugely successful at the box office, making over $6 million on a $350,000 budget and kicking off the \"biker movie\" cycle.He wanted to make a film about the Red Baron, but Columbia turned it down because of The Blue Max (1966). He proposed a movie about the St Valentine's Day Massacre and also an adaptation of the novel Only Lovers Left Alive. Nick Ray was meant to be making Only Lovers in Britain.\nCorman did begin directing Long Ride Home with Glenn Ford at Columbia. However, Corman left production a few weeks into the shoot in June 1966 and was replaced by Phil Karlson. The film was retitled A Time for Killing (1967).\nCorman received an offer to direct a studio film,The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (1967), for 20th Century Fox, starring Jason Robards and George Segal. He did not enjoy the restrictions of working for a major studio. He was given a $2.5 million budget and made it for $400,000 less. Corman, an independent director, was most comfortable in his own style:  shoestring budgets and shooting schedules measured in days, rather than weeks. Nonetheless, it is generally considered one of his best films as a director.\nCorman was meant to follow this with Robert E. Lee for United Artists at a budget of $4.5 million. It was not made. Neither was a story Corman optioned, The Spy in the Vatican.\n\nReturn to independence\nHe continued to finance films for Filmgroup: Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965), dubbing a Soviet movie Planeta Bur into English with some additional footage shot by Curtis Harrington, Queen of Blood (1966), using some Soviet footage but a mostly new film, directed by Harrington, Blood Bath (1966), an adapted Yugoslavian film with additional footage shot by Stephanie Rothman and Jack Hill, and  Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women (1967), yet another dubbed version of Planeta Bur with some additional footage shot by Corman's then-assistant Peter Bogdanovich.\nHe had money in Navy vs. the Night Monsters (1967). He financed two Westerns shot back to back in Utah, directed by Monte Hellman and written and co-produced by Jack Nicholson, The Shooting (1967) and Ride in the Whirlwind (1967), which became cult successes. He also financed two films directed by Dan Haller, Devil's Angels (1967), a follow-up to Wild Angels written by Griffith, and a car racing film shot in Europe, The Wild Racers (1968). He announced a comedy about the population explosion, There Just Isn't Any Room, but it appears to have never been made.Corman directed The Trip for AIP, written by Jack Nicholson and starring Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Bruce Dern. This began the psychedelic film craze of the late 1960s and was the American entry at Cannes that year. AIP made some changes to the film in post-production, which made Corman unhappy.\nIn September 1967, he announced plans to build a new film studio. However, this did not happen for a number of years.\nCorman made a film for American TV, Target: Harry (1968), shot in Europe with his brother producing. He did some uncredited directing on AIP's De Sade (1969) when director Cy Endfield fell ill. He financed Bogdanovich's first feature, Targets (1968), which incorporated footage from The Terror. He also produced The Dunwich Horror (1970) for AIP, directed by Haller and co-written by Curtis Hanson, and financed Haller's Paddy.\n\nFinal films as director\nFor AIP, Corman returned to the director's chair for a gangster film, Bloody Mama (1970), starring Shelley Winters and a young Robert de Niro. It was a big hit at the box office. He also directed a black comedy, Gas-s-s-s (1970), written by George Armitage; it was cut without his permission by AIP and was a financial failure.United Artists finally agreed to finance his Red Baron project, although they asked that it emphasize American characters. Accordingly, it was filmed as Von Richthofen and Brown (1971), shot in Ireland in July 1970. There were several plane crashes during filming and one person died.Corman was going to make a film of Couples, a novel by John Updike for United Artists, and In from a script by Richard Schupe, but decided to take a break from directing.\n\"Directing is very hard and very painful,\" he said in 1971. \"Producing is easy. I can do it without really thinking about it.\"\n\nNew World Pictures\nIn May 1970, Corman founded New World Pictures, which became a small independently owned production/distribution studio, immediately successful with Angels Die Hard (1970), a biker film, and The Student Nurses (1971), directed by Rothman.  The Big Doll House (1971), directed by Jack Hill in the Philippines, was a big hit, making a star of Pam Grier. The company made a profit of $3.2 million in its first financial year, and Corman says all eleven out of his first eleven films were successful.  Angels Die Hard led to a series of biker films, including Angels Hard as They Come (1971), produced by Jonathan Demme with Jack Fisk working as art director. Bury Me an Angel (1971) was the first biker movie directed by a woman, Barbara Peeters. Corman financed the directorial debuts of Curtis Hanson, Sweet Kill (1971), produced by Corman protege Tamara Asseyev.  Student Nurses led to a \"cycle\" of nurse pictures, including Private Duty Nurses (the first film directed by George Armitage), Night Call Nurses (1972) (the first feature directed by Jonathan Kaplan), The Young Nurses and Candy Stripe Nurses (1975). There was also The Student Teachers (1973) and Summer School Teachers (1974).  Big Doll House was followed by a series of women in prison pictures, such as Women in Cages (1972), The Hot Box (1972), Black Mama, White Mama (1973), The Arena (1974) (the first film directed by Steve Carver) and Caged Heat (1974) (the first film directed by Demme).  Of New World's second year, Corman says 11 of the 12 releases were successful.  Corman produced one more film at AIP, Boxcar Bertha (1972), the second feature directed by Martin Scorsese, starring David Carradine. He also executive produced Unholy Rollers (1972) for AIP.  A proposed political satire, The Wild Political Prank, was not made.  He made I Escaped from Devil's Island (1973) with his brother and produced Cockfighter (1974) with Monte Hellman, which was a rare financial failure for New World.  A big hit was Big Bad Mama (1974), a gangster film directed by Carver and starring Angie Dickinson. It led to a follow-up, Crazy Mama (1975), produced by his wife and directed by Demme.  In 1975, Corman said New World was \"the most successful independent film company in the country...if you count AIP as a major\". He said they were \"the best of the cheap acts\".\n\nDistributing foreign films\nIn the 1970s the major Hollywood studios were moving away from distributing foreign arthouse pictures, New World moved into the market and became the U.S. distributor for Cries and Whispers (1972), directed by Ingmar Bergman. Corman bought it for $75,000 and it earned over $2 million at the U.S. box office. and Corman's distribution side of New World brought many foreign films to mass audiences in the U.S. for the first time - reportedly some played at drive-ins and grindhouses - including the works of François Truffaut (The Story of Adele H., Small Change), Peter Weir (The Cars That Ate Paris), Federico Fellini (Amarcord), Joseph Losey (The Romantic Englishwoman), Volker Schlöndorff (The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum, The Tin Drum) and Akira Kurosawa (Dersu Uzala). New World also released Fantastic Planet (1974).\nIn a 10-year period, New World Pictures won more Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film than all other studios combined.\n\n20th Century Fox\nHe had a four-picture deal with 20th Century Fox, making Capone (1975), Fighting Mad (1976) (directed by Demme), Moving Violation (1976) and Thunder and Lightning (1977).\n\nPeak of New World\nDeath Race 2000 (1975), written by Robert Thom and directed by Paul Bartel, was a big hit, earning $4 million. It helped inspire a series of car chase movies: Cannonball (1976), directed by Bartel; Eat My Dust! (1976), directed by Griffith starring Ron Howard, which led to a follow-up, Grand Theft Auto (1978), Howard's directorial debut. There was also The Great Texas Dynamite Chase (1976), Deathsport (1978) and Smokey Bites the Dust (1981).\nNew World's trailers were cut by Joe Dante and Alan Arkush. Corman gave them the chance to direct together, with Hollywood Boulevard (1976), which used outtakes from other New World films. It was successful enough for Corman to give both men jobs directing features on their own: Dante with Piranha (1978) and Arkush with Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979).\nPiranha was written by John Sayles, who had been discovered by Corman's story editor, Frances Doel. Sayles later wrote The Lady in Red (1979) for Corman, which was directed by Lewis Teague.\nOther popular films around this time included Tidal Wave (1975), a Japanese film to which Corman added some extra footage, and Jackson County Jail (1976). He also financed I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. Less popular was Avalanche (1979), a disaster film directed by Corey Allen.\nFor Universal he made Fast Charlie... the Moonbeam Rider (1979), directed by Carver. He financed Bogdanovich's Saint Jack (1979).\nCorman was criticized when he insisted on the addition of footage featuring a rape for Humanoids from the Deep (1980). Similarly, in Galaxy of Terror, as noted on Schlock and Awe...some, \"Corman promised the investors that the film would feature a Taaffe O'Connell sex-scene and a gruesome death-scene as-well. To save time, Corman put the two together. The actress agreed to a nude scene, but NOT a rape scene. Corman isn't the kind of man who takes no for an answer, and after some contract renegotiation, O'Connell agreed to being raped to death by a giant worm-monster. Money… it does amazing things.\"The success of Star Wars inspired New World's most expensive film yet, Battle Beyond the Stars (1981). This film required extensive special effects, prompting Corman to buy a movie studio in Main Street Venice for $1.5 million. Corman made a TV film for CBS, The Georgia Peaches (1980).\nBattle Beyond the Stars was so successful Corman had its footage and music score reused in other films such as Galaxy of Terror (1981) and Forbidden World (1982).\nHe picked up a film called The Personals (1983) which enjoyed success.\n\nMillennium Films\nCorman sold New World Pictures in January 1983 to a consortium of three lawyers for $16.9 million.Under the terms of the contract, he agreed to stay on as a consultant for two years and to provide New World with at least five films they could release. New World agreed to distribute all of Corman's films until March 1984. He set up a new production company, Millennium – the title of which was taken from the name of a 1981 retrospective of Corman's work at the National Film Theatre of London. He announced plans to make films budgeted between $2–5 million using cash from his sale of New World to finance personally. He announced an intention to make fewer commercial films, movies more like I Never Promised You a Rose Garden and Cries and Whispers.\nMillennium's films included Space Raiders (1983), a science fiction epic using footage and music from Battle Beyond the Stars; Love Letters (1984), a serious drama from Amy Holden Jones; Screwballs (1984), a sex comedy in the vein of Porky's; Suburbia (1984), directed by Penelope Spheeris, which he acquired, Deathstalker; and Kain of Dark Planet (which became The Warrior and the Sorceress).\n\nNew Horizons\nCorman says people struggled with the name \"Millennium\" – \"nobody could spell it, nobody knew what it meant\" – so he changed it to New Horizons by early 1984.Corman and the new owners of New World ended up suing each other in March 1985. Corman claimed that New World failed to honor their guarantee to distribute his movies at a fee of 15%. He sought $400 million in damages and the return of the company. He said they refused to distribute School Spirit (1985) and Wheels of Fire. He also claimed that New World cheated him distributing Space Raiders, Screwballs and Slumber Party Massacre. New World sued Corman in return, claiming he was seeking to return to distribution, and was discrediting New World to potential investors. They said Corman bypassed New World for some of his films, such as Columbia's Hardbodies (1984). Corman argued \"My whole point in selling was to free myself of the burden of running the company and to get guaranteed distribution. If I can't get my guaranteed distribution, I'm forced to go back to running the company.\"\n\nConcorde Pictures\nThe case with New World settled out of court. In March 1985 Corman announced he would establish a new distribution \"cooperative\", Concorde Pictures, where producers could get relatively cheap distribution from Concorde in exchange for contributing to the company's overhead. Their first releases were Corman productions School Spirit, Wheels of Fire and Barbarian Queen. Concorde later merged with a low budget production company, Cinema Group, and announced plans to make 15-20 films a year.Early Concorde releases include Loose Screws (1985), a sequel to Screwballs;  Streetwalkin' (1985), a more serious drama directed by Joan Freeman; Cocaine Wars (1986), the first in a series of movies Corman would finance in South America; Hour of the Assassin (1987), shot in Peru and the first film directed by Luis Llosa; and Munchies (1987), a spoof of Gremlins directed by Tina Hirsch.\nCorman also remade Not of this Earth (1988) and released Big Bad Mama II (1987), and Transylvania Twist (1989); all three were directed by Jim Wynorski. He produced another version of Masque of the Red Death (1989), directed by Larry Brand.\nHe produced Sweet Revenge (1987), Slumber Party Massacre II (1988), directed by Deborah Brock, Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure (1988), also directed by Brock, and The Terror Within (1989), directed by Thierry Notz.\nCorman financed the early directorial efforts of Carl Franklin (Nowhere to Run (1989)), Vargas Llosa and Katt Shea (Stripped to Kill (1988), Stripped to Kill II (1989)). More experimental was Nightfall (1988).\nAfter Hour of the Assassin, he made a series of films in Peru, including Crime Zone (1989), also directed by Luis Llosa, and Full Fathom Five (1990), directed by Carl Franklin.\nConcorde had a big hit with Bloodfist (1989), starring Don \"the Dragon\" Wilson which cost $1 million and earned over $6 million. Concorde signed Wilson to a long-term contract and he made a number of sequels for the company, including Bloodfist II and Fighting to Win.\n\nFrankenstein Unbound\nHe returned to directing once more with Frankenstein Unbound (1990).\n\nConcorde and New Horizon in the 1990s\nIn 1990, Concorde sued MGM for $6 million.Concorde's films included Overexposed (1990), The Unborn (1991), and In the Heat of Passion (1992). They had a big hit with Carnosaur (1993), which led to several sequels. He financed Fire on the Amazon (1991, directed Luis Llosa) which had Sandra Bullock and Craig Sheffer in early roles.\nCorman had to deal with the decline of the drive-in market and studio competition through the 1990s, but Concorde-New Horizons still made 15-24 pictures a year. This included a never-released version of The Fantastic Four.\n\nRoger Corman Presents\nIn 1995 Corman was executive producer on Roger Corman Presents, a special series of 13 movies for Showtime with budgets of around $1.5 million each. \"I think the Corman name means action, humor and some titillation,\" says Mike Elliott, the producer of the series. \"It's going to deliver the goods – and it will have a little moral statement in there as well.\" Corman ended up doing a second season of 11 movies. The films were Bram Stoker's Burial of the Rats, Hellfire, Virtual Seduction, Suspect Device, Unknown Origin, Terminal Virus, Where Evil Lies, Vampirella, Shadow of a Scream, Subliminal Seduction, House of the Damned (a.k.a. Spectre), The Haunted Sea, Alien Avengers (a.k.a. Aliens Among Us) and its sequel, Inhumanoid, Sawbones, Not Like Us, and Last Exit to Earth. He created his own comic book franchise, Black Scorpion, which led to a sequel and later a TV series. Corman also executive-produced remakes of The Wasp Woman, Humanoids from the Deep, A Bucket of Blood (a.k.a. The Death Artist), Piranha and Not of this Earth.\n\nIreland\nConcorde set up operations in Ireland as Concorde Anois, building studios in Connemara, County Galway. He received some support from the Irish government, a decision which became controversial when the content of some Corman productions such as Criminal Affairs was criticized in the press.Later Concorde-New Horizons films included Overdrive (1997). \"The genres still hold\", said Corman in 1997, \"action adventure, the suspense thriller, science fiction and horror. The difference is that they are bigger and better now. \"Corman also produced the film Moving Target which was filmed in County Galway. It was his last film produced with Concorde-New Horizons.\n\nRoger Corman's Cosmic Comics\nCorman operated a short-lived comic book imprint in 1995–1996 called Roger Corman's Cosmic Comics. It produced comics based on his films, written and drawn in a similar no-hold-barred style. Titles included Bram Stoker's Burial of the Rats, Caged Heat 3000, Death Race 2020, Welcome to The Little Shop of Horrors, and Rock & Roll High School — the latter featuring the Melvins (instead of the Ramones). Notable creators published by Cosmic Comics included Trevor Goring, James Kochalka, Jason Lutes, Pat Mills, Shane Oakley, Jerry Prosser, and J. R. Williams. The longest-running title was Death Race 2020, which lasted eight issues — but was left unfinished when the company closed down.\n\nLater career:  Syfy Channel\nHe continued to produce creature films, such as Raptor (2001, dir Jim Wynorski). Dinocroc (2004), which aired on the Syfy cable television channel and was popular enough for two sequels, Supergator and Dinocroc vs. Supergator (2010), as well as a spin-off film, Dinoshark (2010). Supergator (2007) was turned down by the Syfy channel, but Corman made it anyway.\nCorman also continued to make action films: Escape from Afghanistan (2001) was a Russian film, Peshavar Waltz plus some additional footage; The Hunt for Eagle One (2006) and The Hunt for Eagle One: Crash Point (2006) were shot in the Philippines; Roger Corman's Operation Rogue (2014); Fist of the Dragon (2015).\nIn 2006 Corman said he made 60% of his films overseas. \"These foreign countries are offering subsidies that are so great that not only I but many independent producers are moving overseas\", he said. He sold the remake rights of Death Race 2000 to Universal, who made Death Race (2008) with Jason Statham, with Corman credited as executive producer. It led to two direct-to-video prequels and one direct-to-video sequel.\nIn 2009, Corman produced and directed alongside director Joe Dante the web series \"Splatter\" for Netflix. The protagonist of the film is portrayed by Corey Feldman, and the story talks of the haunting tale of rock-and-roll legend Johnny Splatter. He also started contributing trailer commentaries to Dante's web series Trailers from Hell. In 2011, Corman cited James Cameron's Avatar (2009) and Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) as examples of \"great imagination and originality\".By now, the SyFy channel was Corman's leading market. For them, he made Sharktopus (2010) and Piranhaconda (2012). Corman produced the 2017 film Death Race 2050, a sequel to the 1975 film Death Race 2000. It was made with Universal, Corman's first film with a major studio in more than two decades.\n\nPersonal life\nCorman married Julie Halloran in 1970. They have four children. On April 3, 2018, a lawsuit by Corman's sons, Roger Martin Corman and Brian Corman, was filed against Corman to prevent the trade of his film collection. It was settled in 2020. In 2016, Corman also sued a wealth management company about suspected losses of his personal fortune. To date, the result of that dispute has not been disclosed.\n\nRecognition\nIn 1964, Corman was the youngest producer/director to be given a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, as well as retrospectives at the British Film Institute and the Museum of Modern Art.\nCorman won the Lifetime Achievement Award at Stockholm International Film Festival in 1990.\nCorman was the subject of the 1978 documentary Roger Corman:  Hollywood's Wild Angel, produced and directed by Christian Blackwood.

The Academy Film Archive restored Corman's film The Masque of the Red Death in 2019.\n\n\"The Corman Film School\"\nA number of noted filmmakers (including directors, producers, writers, and cinematographers) have worked with Corman, usually early in their careers, including Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Polly Platt, Peter Bogdanovich, Declan O'Brien, Armondo Linus Acosta, Paul Bartel, Jonathan Demme, Donald G.

Cameron, Coppola, Demme, Hanson, Howard and Scorsese have all gone on to win Academy Awards.

In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films. He worked frequently at the Poverty Row studio Chesterfield Pictures during the 1930s. The first full-length motion picture he directed for MGM was Last of the Pagans (1935) starring Ray Mala. \nAt MGM, he teamed up with producer Pandro S. Berman in the 1950s, with whom he made several films, including Ivanhoe (1952), The Prisoner of Zenda (1952), Knights of the Round Table (1953), All the Brothers Were Valiant (1953) and The Adventures of Quentin Durward (1955).\nAfter directing The Last Challenge in 1967, he retired from the film industry.\nHis two favorite films were Night Must Fall (1937) and Two Girls and a Sailor (1944).\n\nWizard of Oz\nThorpe is also known as the original director of The Wizard of Oz. He was fired after two weeks of shooting because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy \"baby-doll\" makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about 13. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe's work on the film survive today.

{"input": "Who is the spouse of the director of film Emergency Wedding?", "context": "Passage 1:\nSophia Magdalena of Denmark\nSophia Magdalena of Denmark (Danish: Sophie Magdalene; Swedish: Sofia Magdalena; 3 July 1746 – 21 August 1813) was Queen of Sweden from 1771 to 1792 as the wife of King Gustav III. \nBorn into the House of Oldenburg, the royal family of Denmark-Norway, Sophia Magdalena was the first daughter of King Frederick V of Denmark and Norway and his first consort, Princess Louise of Great Britain. Already at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, as part of an attempt to improve the traditionally tense relationship between the two Scandinavian realms. She was subsequently brought up to be the Queen of Sweden, and they married in 1766. In 1771, Sophia's husband ascended to the throne and became King of Sweden, making Sophia Queen of Sweden. Their coronation was on 29 May 1772.\nThe politically arranged marriage was unsuccessful. The desired political consequences for the mutual relations between the two countries did not materialize, and on a personal level the union also proved to be unhappy. Sophia Magdalena was of a quiet and serious nature, and found it difficult to adjust to her husband's pleasure seeking court. She dutifully performed her ceremonial duties but did not care for social life and was most comfortable in quiet surroundings with a few friends. However, she was liked by many in the Caps party, believing she was a symbol of virtue and religion. The relationship between the spouses improved somewhat in the years from 1775 to 1783, but subsequently deteriorated again.\nAfter her husband was assassinated in 1792, Sophia Magdalena withdrew from public life, and led a quiet life as dowager queen until her death in 1813.\n\nEarly life\nPrincess Sophie Magdalene was born on 3 July 1746 at her parents' residence Charlottenborg Palace, located at the large square, Kongens Nytorv, in central Copenhagen. She was the second child and first daughter of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his first consort, the former Princess Louise of Great Britain, and was named for her grandmother, Queen Sophie Magdalene. She received her own royal household at birth.\nJust one month after her birth, her grandfather King Christian VI died, and Princess Sophie Magdalene's father ascended the throne as King Frederick V. She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage. She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark.In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden. The marriage was arranged by the Riksdag of the Estates, not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm.After the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate. She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong phobia.\n\nIn 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige. The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated.\nWhen a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"\n\nCrown Princess\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over Öresund to Hälsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav himself. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court.\nThe couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at Stäket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at Säby Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: \"By God, how beautiful she is!\", but that her appearance was affected by the fact that she had a: \"terrible fear of the Queen\". On 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, where she was married to Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace.Sophia Magdalena initially made a good impression upon the Swedish nobility with her beauty, elegance and skillful dance; but her shy, silent, and reserved nature soon made her a disappointment in the society life. Being of a reserved nature, she was considered cold and arrogant. Her mother-in-law Queen Louisa Ulrika, who once stated that she could comprehend nothing more humiliating than the position of a Queen Dowager, harassed her in many ways: a typical example was when she invited Gustav to her birthday celebrations, but asked him to make Sophia Magdalena excuse herself by pretending to be too ill to attend. Louisa Ulrika encouraged a distance between the couple in various ways, and Gustav largely ignored her so as not to make his mother jealous.\nSophia Magdalena was known to be popular with the Caps, who were supported by Denmark, while Louisa Ulrika and Gustav sided with the Hats. The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support. Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home. This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship. In 1768, Charlotta Sparre tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence Ekolsund Castle, but the marriage remained unconsummated.After King Adolf Frederick of Sweden died in 1771, Gustav III became King of Sweden. The following year, on 29 May, Sophia Magdalena was crowned Queen.\n\nEarly reign as Queen\nThe coronation of Gustav III and Sophia Magdalena took place on 29 May 1772. She was not informed about the coup of Gustav III, which reinstated absolute monarchy and ended the parliamentary rule of the Estates in the revolution of 1772. At the time she was deemed as suspicious and politically untrustworthy in the eyes of the King, primarily by her mother-in-law, who painted her as pro-Danish. Denmark was presumed to oppose the coup; there were also plans to conquer Norway from Denmark.\nSophia Magdalena was informed about politics nonetheless: she expressed herself pleased with the 1772 parliament because Count Fredrik Ribbing, for whom she had taken an interest, had regained his seat. The conflict between her and her mother-in-law was publicly known and disliked, and the sympathies were on her side. In the contemporary paper Dagligt Allehanda, a fable was presented about Rävinnan och Turturduvan (\"The She Fox and the Turtle Dove\"). The fable was about the innocent turtle dove (Sophia Magdalena) who was slandered by the wicked she fox (Louisa Ulrika), who was supported by the second she fox (Anna Maria Hjärne) and the other foxes (the nobility). The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps party.Queen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character, and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents. In 1777, for example, she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse.As queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation – more than what had been expected from previous queens due to her husband's adoration of representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to royal court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. For instance, on 17 September 1784, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783–84, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks. During that time, she appeared at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more.\nSophia appeared to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side with only one lady-in-waiting and two footmen, however, her country side visitations were stopped because it was deemed 'unsuitable'. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces: Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von Höpken and Lovisa Meijerfelt, as well as Marianne Ehrenström and Charlotta Cedercreutz, who were known artists.\nSophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: on 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibröder, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.\n\nIn the famous diary of her sister-in-law, Princess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte, Sophia Magdalena is described as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, very polite and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described her as \"Forced to meet people\".Sophia Magdalena preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, Maria Aurora Uggla and Baroness Virginia Charlotta Manderström, but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational  duties. She frequently visited the theater, and she also had a great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history. She educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian, and regularly read French magazines. According to Augusta von Fersen, Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation.In 1784, after the King had returned from his trip to Italy and France, the relationship between the King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission.\nIn 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him if he took their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him.\nQueen Sophia Magdalena was never involved in politics, except for one on one occasion. In August 1788, during the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), the King gave her the task to enter in negotiations with Denmark to prevent a declaration of war from Denmark during the ongoing war against Russia. He asked her to call upon the Danish ambassador Reventlow and give him a letter to be read in the Danish royal council before her brother, the Danish King. He gave her the freedom to write as she wished, but to use the argument that she spoke as a sister and mother to a son with the right to the Danish throne and upon her own initiative.\nSophia Magdalena called upon the Danish ambassador, held a speech to him followed by a long conversation and then handed him a letter written as a \"warm appeal\" to her brother. A copy was sent to Gustav III, and her letter was read in the royal Danish council, where it reportedly made a good impression. However, her mission was still unsuccessful, as the Russo-Danish alliance made it unavoidable for Denmark to declare war shortly afterward. At the time, there was a note that she met two Russian prisoners of war in the park of the Haga Palace, and gave them 100 kronor each.\n\nAt the parliament of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility and to gain support for the war and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act led to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of Jeanna von Lantingshausen as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, Sophie Albertine of Sweden and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways than what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window. She was known to dislike the reforms of 1789, and she did let it be known to its representatives. At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksråd Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.\nIn the autumn of 1790, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of Drottningholm Palace well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent. He accused her of having been manipulated by the female courtiers into participating in the political demonstration, and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving. This applied especially to Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie and Augusta von Fersen, who did not participate in the boycott: he suspected Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however is not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak of politics in her presence. The reason to why she wished to leave was reportedly due to her health, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an ear infection. The King did in any case suspect her of being in political opposition to him, and before his trip to Aachen in 1791, he ordered that his son was to be separated from her during his absence abroad. When she was made aware of this, Sophia Magdalena caused a public scene when she visited him in his box at the opera and demanded to be given access to her son. This led to a heated argument and she left the box with the words: \"I will have my vengeance, monsieur! I give you my sacred vow on that!\"\n\nSuccession issues\nSophia Magdalena is mostly known in Swedish history for the scandal created around the consummation of her marriage and the questioned legitimacy of her son. Her marriage was a then normal arranged royal match for political convenience, in which Sophia Magdalena at first was described by her spouse as \"cold as ice\". Sophia Magdalena's religious upbringing and introverted character made her avoid the lively and spontaneous Gustavian court life, which made her even less attractive in the eyes of her outgoing spouse.Their marriage was not consummated until 1775, nine years after the wedding. The status quo between Gustav III and his consort was nurtured by the Queen Dowager, Louisa Ulrika, who did not want competition in her influence over her son. There were rumors that the King was a homosexual or sexually underdeveloped. His sexuality, which had much effect on Sophia Magdalena's life, as a royal marriage was designed to produce offspring, has been much debated. His sexual inexperience has been blamed on immaturity or him also being asexual.\nAs a teenager, Gustav had a crush on Axel von Fersen's mother, Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie, though this affection was never physical. In 1768, he had another infatuation with the noble Charlotte Du Rietz, but this is not believed to have been sexually consummated either. Various documents written during his lifetime alleged that he was bisexual or homosexual.\nHis sister-in-law, Princess Charlotte, claims that the King did participate in homosexual activity after his trip to Italy in 1784 and that there were several rumors about this: she claims that she herself had witnessed that the park at Drottningholm Palace had become a place where male courtiers searched for homosexual partners, and in a letter to Sophie von Fersen, she writes in code: \n\n\"It is said that the King recently attacked a young man in the park at night and offered him the post of chamberlain to the Queen if he agreed to his lusts, but the young man preferred to leave. Agree that this is to take things too far. It is said that the trips to Svartsjö Palace are made to be provide privacy, it is unbelievable, but it is what it is said. I could tell you a million things about this.\"\nIn 1791, Sophia Magdalena herself paid a surprise visit to the King during his stay at the Gustav III's Pavilion, where the King had spent more time since he came in conflict with the nobility after the 1789 parliament; and where he was reputed to indulge in orgies. She found the King in bed, and he asked one of his favorites, Count Fabian Wrede, to show her around. In the King's private chamber, however, the Queen found the actor and page of the King, Lars Hjortsberg, sleeping, naked. The Queen reacted by interrupting the tour by saying to Wrede that he apparently did not know his way around Haga, as he had obviously showed her the chamber of the staff rather than the King by mistake.Some sources explain that both the Queen and the King had serious anatomical problems resulting in erotic complications. Erik Lönnroth has concluded that there is no factual proof for the rumors that Gustav III was inclined toward homosexuality or bisexuality, nor that Gustav Adolf was illegitimate.\n\nDuring the Coup of Gustav III on 19 August 1772, Sophia Magdalena was at Ekolsund Castle. After having been told of the successful coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hjärne, that she was afraid that she would now be divorced by Gustav, because she knew she was not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because she knew she was being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, that he did plan to divorce her on the grounds of pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksråd Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. Von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made her laugh, among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hjärne. Countess Hjärne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant, \"And the riksråd Ribbing is her favorite.\"The King had given Countess Ulrica Catharina Stromberg the task to investigate this, and she was told by the chamber madame of Sophia Magdalena, Charlotta Hellman, that: \"information, which where dubious, especially since the clearest evidence could be gathered from the linen of the Queen\". Her contact with Rosencrone is said to have been restricted to the fact that he handled her correspondence with Denmark. After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.\nIn 1774, the King arranged the marriage between his brother, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, and Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, to solve, for the time being, the immediate question of an heir to the throne. The Duchess had false pregnancies and miscarriages only, which may have hastened the King to expedite the consummation of his own marriage and produce a son of his own.\nIn 1778, Sophia Magdalena gave birth to Gustav Adolf, successor to the throne, and in 1782, she gave birth to a second son, Charles Gustav, who only lived for one year. It was suggested in some circles that King Gustav's first son was sired by someone else. When the heir was born, the father was believed, by the Queen Dowager among others, to be Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila, then Riksstallmästare. This rumor was believed by elements of the public and the royal court, and her acquiescence to it led to a year-long break between the Queen Dowager and her son.\n\nSuccession scandal\nThe King, claiming to be sexually inexperienced, called upon Munck to help him with a reconciliation with his spouse, instruct the couple in the ways of sexual intercourse, and physically show them how to consummate their marriage. Munck, a Finnish nobleman and, at the time, a stable master was, at that point, the lover of Anna Sofia Ramström, the Queen's chamber maid. Through Anna Sofia Ramström, Munck contacted Ingrid Maria Wenner, who was assigned to inform the queen of the king's wish, because she was married and the confidant of the queen. Munck and Ramström were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber. Munck himself writes in his written account, which is preserved at the National Archives of Sweden, that to succeed, he was obliged to touch them both physically.When it became known that Munck participated in the reconciliation between the royal couple, there were rumours that he was the father of Sophia Magdalena's firstborn.These became the subject of accusations from the political opposition, as late as in 1786 and 1789,: 132  where it was claimed that the whole nation was aware of the rumour that the King had asked Munck to make the Queen pregnant.: 118  Pamphlets to that end were posted on street corners all over Stockholm.: 143 This was also caricatured by Carl August Ehrensvärd in private letters discovered later – his drawing was published in 1987 —, where he passed on a number of rumors and jokes about Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena and Munck without inferring that he believed they were true. There was also a rumour that the King and Queen had divorced in secret and that the Queen had married Munck.There is no proof that Munck was the father of the crown prince. Erik Lönnroth has suggested that the anatomical problems mentioned in Munck's account, known only to a few initiated persons, were the primary factor in their delay in producing an heir. At the time, the rumors became more persistent, however, when the royal couple presented Munck with gifts: the King promoted him, and the Queen gave Munck a pension, a diamond ring, and a watch with her image.A few socialites took the Queen Mother's side in supporting and spreading the rumors, such as Anna Charlotta Schröderheim and Eva Helena Löwen.The circle around the King's brother, Duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, who desired the throne, also encouraged these rumors. Their mother was quoted as saying, during the pregnancy of Sophia Magdalena, that there were rumors among the public that the future child was illegitimate, and that she herself believed that the King had hired Munck to impregnate the Queen, and that she would never accept that the throne would come into the hands of \"a common nobleman's illegitimate offspring\".: 103–4 The Queen Mother ordered Duke Charles to interrogate Munck, and word spread to the King, who was shocked. Sophia Magdalena was equally shocked by the accusations. She swore she would never speak to the Queen Dowager again, and indeed she never did.\nThe King arranged for his mother to make a public apology for her accusation in the presence of the rest of the Royal Family the 12 May 1778. The scene gained a lot of attention and broke the bonds between Gustav III and his mother. The scandal disturbed celebrations, as did an accident with the public banquet. The public was invited to a great feast to celebrate the birth of the heir, but too many people were let in, and the crowd panicked. Between sixty and one hundred people were trampled to death in the crowd.\nSven Anders Hedin, a medical doctor at the royal court, and married to one of the Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two statements which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom.  To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor on his way to the Queen's bedchamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: \"In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!\" in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned.\n\nIn 1782, Sophia Magdalena had a second son. After the death of her younger son in 1783, her marriage deteriorated. In May 1784, Sophia Magdalena is believed to have had a miscarriage, and after this, there are no further notes of any pregnancies. A brief reconciliation in 1787 was deemed by Duchess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in her diaries as temporary, with no hope of being complete and lasting,: 191  as the King was not \"receptive to female charm\": another insinuation that he was homosexual.\nIn 1787, Sophia Magdalena deposited a sum of 50.000 riksdaler in an account for Munck, which was generally rumoured to be a \"farewell gift\".: 156–7   At this point, Munck had started an affair with the ballerina Giovanna Bassi, to whom Sophia Magdalena showed great dislike.: 157   The King was terrified when he heard that the Queen had made that deposit, and he tried to prevent the transaction from becoming public knowledge, which, however, did not succeed.: 157  Munck was, however, continued to be used as a go-between and a messenger between the King and the Queen, especially during conflicts.\nA child of Giovanna Bassi's, rumored to be the child of Munck, bore a strong likeness to the Crown Prince.\n\nQueen Dowager\nOn 16 March 1792 Gustav III was attacked and mortally wounded. Sophia Magdalena was reportedly shocked and horrified by the attack. The conspirators intended to make her the regent of her son during his minority.: 443  As a Guardian government had been necessary by putting a minor monarch on the throne, their plan was to offer this role to Sophia Magdalena by taking military control and offering the Queen dowager the role of presiding over the guardian council instead of her brother-in-law Duke Charles. Directly after she was told of the attack, Sophia Magdalena sent for the king's favorite, Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, and was taken by him to the sick bed of the King. There, she took the hands of the King between hers and cried out to Armfelt: \"How horrifying! Such a cruel atrocity!\" She was kept informed of his state by Armfelt, but she was prevented from further visits because Gustav did not wish to receive visits from women because of the smell from his wounds. At the death of Gustav III 29 March 1792, she attempted to visit him, but she was blocked by her brother-in-law Duke Charles, who fell on his knees before her to stop her from entering the bed room.\nSophia Magdalena caused a scandal as it was noted that she did not dress in mourning except when she was forced to do so at visits and on formal occasions.: 442   This criticism was likely worsened because she was exposed to some suspicions, as it was known that the conspirators had planned to make her regent.\nAs Queen Dowager, it was a relief to Sophia Magdalena to withdraw from public life. Her brother-in-law, Duke Charles, became regent, and she eschewed a political role. As a widow, Sophia Magdalena lived a withdrawn life. She did not wish to take part in any representational duties, and she gave up her quarters at Drottningholm Palace to be relieved of them. She lived in the Royal Palace in Stockholm during the winter, and at Ulriksdal Palace during the summer. She lived in a circle of her own court, and seldom entertained any guests other than her lifelong friends Maria Aurora Uggla and Virginia Manderström. It is noted that, although she had hated the male favorites of her spouse during his lifetime, she gave several of them positions in her court as a widow. Sophia Magdalena had a close relationship with her son, King Gustav IV Adolf, who visited her regularly and with whom she shared an interest in religion.\n\nIn 1797, she insisted on skipping the protocol at the reception of her daughter-in-law, Frederica of Baden. The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not greet her daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace with the rest of the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: \"I know myself how I suffered, when I arrived to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. As for my daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!\" During the reign of her son, she seldom showed herself at court except on Sundays and at court presentations, and preferred to stay at her estate. She regularly met her son and his family on family visits, but she did not participate in court life.\nIn 1809 she witnessed the coup and following abdication of her son, King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, after Sweden lost Finland to Russia. She was deeply affected by his deposition. On the day of the coup, she was informed by her friend Maria Aurora Uggla, and in her company she immediately rushed to the quarters of her son. She was prevented from seeing him by guards, and burst into tears in the arms of Uggla. Shortly after, she was visited in her quarters by Duke Charles in the company of guards, who officially told her what had happened and made her burst into tears again by officially banning her from seeing her son. When she, during the captivity of her son, formally applied for permission to see him, and was told by Charles that she could not unless given permission by the government, she publicly commented: \"The government was not asked for permission for the murder of my husband, neither any permission was sought to depose and imprison my son, but I must have their permission, to speak to my child.\" She was never to see her son again, but she corresponded with him for the rest of her life. He was sent into exile and replaced by his paternal uncle Charles XIII, but she remained in Sweden until her death. She did, however, say goodbye to her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren when they left Stockholm to join Gustav Adolf.\nIn January 1810, she was presented to the elected heir to the throne, Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she was presented to the next elected heir to the throne, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: \"I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believes that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit of dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!\" At the meeting, her face was said to have turned white, but at the end, she is said to have been delighted by his charm. In 1811, she was one of the few in the Swedish Court who were nice to Désirée Clary.\nIn September 1812, Germaine de Staël was presented to her, and gave her the impression of her: \"Her Majesty analyzed my books as an educated woman, whose judgement showed as much thoroughness as well as delicate feeling. Never has any one impressed me such as your Queen! I almost dared not reply to her, so taken was I by the royal glory around her – it gave me such respect, that I shivered!\" When the Crown Prince banned any contact between Swedes and the former royal family, Germaine de Staël asked that an exception was to be made for Sophia Magdalena, and it was: her letters were however read by foreign minister Lars von Engeström.\n\nLater life and death\nSophia Magdalena lived more isolated towards the end of her life and was affected by worsened health. From 1812, she devoted much of her time to her friendship with the young amateur botanic Baron Anton Fredrik Wrangel. She never fully recovered after having suffered a stroke in May 1813.\n\nChildren\nIn popular culture\nThe affair of the consummation of her marriage and the succession scandal was portrayed in SVT's period drama production of \"Gustav III:s äktenskap\" (The Marriage of Gustav III) in 2001, where Sophia Magdalena was portrayed by Danish actress Iben Hjejle.\nIt was also used to inspire the novel Drottningens juvelsmycke, famous in Sweden, where the character of Tintomara is portrayed as a half sibling of Gustav IV Adolf through Count Munck.\n\nAncestry\nInline references\nBibliographic references\nAlm, Mikael (2003–2006).

Gibson\nHeather Denise Gibson (Greek: Χέδερ Ντενίζ Γκίμπσον) is a Scottish economist currently serving as Director-Advisor to the Bank of Greece (since 2011). She was the spouse of Euclid Tsakalotos, former Greek Minister of Finance.\n\nAcademic career\nBefore assuming her duties at the Bank of Greece and alternating child-rearing duties with her husband, Gibson worked at the University of Kent, where she published two volumes on international exchange rate mechanisms and wrote numerous articles on this and other topics, sometimes in cooperation with her husband, who was teaching at Kent at the time.\n\nPersonal life\nGibson first came to Greece in 1993, with her husband, with whom she took turns away from their respective economic studies to raise their three children while the other worked.The couple maintain two homes in Kifisia, along with an office in Athens and a vacation home in Preveza. In 2013, this proved detrimental to Tsakalotos and his party when his critics began calling him «αριστερός αριστοκράτης» (aristeros aristokratis, \"aristocrat of the left\"), while newspapers opposed to the Syriza party seized on his property holdings as a chance to accuse the couple of hypocrisy for enjoying a generous lifestyle in private while criticizing the \"ethic of austerity\" in public. One opposition newspaper published on the front page criticism reasoning that Tsakalotos own family wealth came from the same sort of investments in companies as made by financial institutions JP Morgan and BlackRock.\n\nWorks\nEditor\nEconomic Bulletin, Bank of Greece\n\nBooks\nThe Eurocurrency Markets, Domestic Financial Policy and International Instability (London, etc., Longman: 1989) ISBN 0312028261\nInternational Finance: Exchange Rates and Financial Flows in the International Financial System (London, etc., Longman: 1996) ISBN 0582218136\nEconomic Transformation, Democratization and Integration into the European Union (London: Palgrave Macmillan: 2001) ISBN 9780333801222\n\nArticles and papers\n\"Fundamentally Wrong: Market Pricing of Sovereigns and the Greek Financial Crisis,\" Journal of Macroeconomics, Elsevier, vol. 39(PB), pp. 405–419 (with Stephen G. & Tavlas, George S., 2014)\n\"Capital flows and speculative attacks in prospective EU member states\" (with Euclid Tsakalotos, Economics of Transition Volume 12, Issue 3, pages 559–586, September 2004)\n\"A Unifying Framework for Analysing Offsetting Capital Flows and Sterilisation: Germany and the ERM\" (with Sophocles Brissimis & Euclid Tsakalotos, International Journal of Finance & Economics, 2002, vol. 7, issue 1, pp. 63–78)\n\"Internal vs External Financing of Acquisitions: Do Managers Squander Retained Profits\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, Studies in Economics, 1996; Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 2000)\n\"Are Aggregate Consumption Relationships Similar Across the European Union\" (with Alan Carruth & Euclid Tsakalotos, Regional Studies, Volume 33, Issue 1, 1999)\nTakeover Risk and the Market for Corporate Control: The Experience of British Firms in the 1970s and 1980 (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, 1998) PDF\n\"The Impact of Acquisitions on Company Performance: Evidence from a Large Panel of UK Firms\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, Oxford Economic Papers New Series, Vol. 49, No. 3 (Jul., 1997), pp. 344–361)\n\"Short-Termism and Underinvestment: The Influence of Financial Systems\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, The Manchester School of Economic & Social Studies, 1995, vol. 63, issue 4, pp. 351–67)\n\"Testing a Flow Model of Capital Flight in Five European Countries\" (with Euclid Tsakalotos, The Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies, Volume 61, Issue 2, pp. 144–166, June 1993)\nFull list of articles by Heather D Gibson. researchgate.net.

She is also the granddaughter of Agustín Batista y González de Mendoza, who was the founder of the Trust Company of Cuba, the most powerful Cuban bank prior to the Cuban Revolution.In October 1959, at the time of the Cuban Revolution, Maria Teresa Mestre’s parents left Cuba with their children, because the new government headed by Fidel Castro confiscated their properties. The family settled in New York City,  where as a young girl she was a pupil at Marymount School. From 1961 she carried on her studies at the Lycée Français de New York. In her childhood, Maria Teresa Mestre took ballet and singing courses. She practices skiing, ice-skating and water sports. She later lived in Santander, Spain, and in Geneva, Switzerland, where she became a Swiss citizen.In 1980, Maria Teresa graduated from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva with a degree in political sciences. While studying there, she met her future husband Henri of Luxembourg.\n\nSocial and humanitarian interests\nSoon after her marriage, Maria Teresa and the then Hereditary Grand Duke Henri established The Prince Henri and Princess Maria Teresa Foundation to help those with special needs integrate fully into society. In 2001, she and her husband created The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess Foundation, launched upon the accession of the couple as the new Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. In 2004, the Grand Duke Henri and the Grand Duchess Maria Teresa Foundation was created after the merging of the two previous foundations.\nIn 1997, Maria Teresa was made a special ambassador for UNESCO, working to expand education for young girls and women and help to fight poverty.Since 2005, Maria Teresa has been the chairwoman of the international jury of the European Microfinance Award, which annually awards holders of microfinance and inclusive finance initiatives in developing countries. Also, since 2006, Maria Teresa has been honorary president of the LuxFLAG (Luxembourg Fund Labeling Agency), the first agency to label responsible microfinance investment funds around the world.On 19 April 2007, the Grand Duchess was appointed UNICEF Eminent Advocate for Children, in which role she has visited Brazil (2007), China (2008), and Burundi (2009).She is a member of the Honorary Board of the International Paralympic Committee and a patron of the Ligue Luxembourgeoise de Prévention et d’Action medico-sociales and SOS Villages d’Enfants Monde. The Grand Duchess and her husband Grand Duke Henri are the members of the Mentor Foundation (London), created under the patronage of the World Health Organization. She is also the president of the Luxembourg Red Cross and the Cancer Foundation. In 2016, she organized the first international forum on learning disabilities in Luxembourg.The Grand Duchess supports the UNESCO “Breaking the Poverty Cycle of Women” project in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. The purpose of this project is to improve the living conditions of girls, women and their families. As honorary president of her own foundation, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa set up a project called Projet de la Main Tendue after visiting the Bujumbura prison in 2009 in Burundi. The purpose of this project is to liberate minor people from prison and to give them new opportunities for their future.\nIn October 2016, Maria Teresa accepted an invitation to join the eminent international Council of Patrons of the Asian University for Women (AUW) in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The university, which is the product of east-west foundational partnerships (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Open Society Foundation, IKEA Foundation, etc.) and regional cooperation, serves extraordinarily talented women from 15 countries across Asia and the Middle East.In 2019, Maria Teresa presented her initiative \"Stand Speak Rise Up!\" to end sexual violence in fragile environments, launched in cooperation with the Women’s Forum and with the support of the Luxembourg government. The conference is in partnership with the Dr. Denis Mukwege Foundation and We Are Not Weapons of War.In 2020 the Prime Minister of Luxembourg commissioned a report into the Cour le Grand Ducal following concerns over its working. The report found that up to 1/3 of employees had left since 2015 and that \"The most important decisions in the field of personnel management, whether at the level of recruitment, assignment to the various departments or even at the dismissal level are taken by HRH the Grand Duchess.” Several newspaper reports at the time highlighted a 'culture of fear' around the Grand Duchess and \"that no-one bar the Prime Minister dared confront her\". The report also raised concerns about the use of public funds to pay for the Grand Duchess' personal website and that this had been prioritised over the Cour's own official website. There were also allegations that staff at the Court has been subject to physical abuse and these reports were investigated by the Luxembourg judicial police.\nIn February 2023 it was reported by several Luxembourg based media that the Grand Duchess had once again been accused of treating staff poorly during an outfit fitting in October 22. The incident even involved the Prime Minister of Luxembourg having to speak to the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess about the treatment of the staff and commissioning a report into it.\n\nFamily\nMaria Teresa married Prince Henri of Luxembourg in a civil ceremony on 4 February 1981 and a religious ceremony on 14 February 1981, since Valentine's Day was their favourite holiday. The consent of the Grand Duke had been previously given on 7 November 1980. She received a bouquet of red roses and a sugarcane as a wedding gift from Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. The couple has five children: Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Prince Félix of Luxembourg, Prince Louis of Luxembourg, Princess Alexandra of Luxembourg, and Prince Sébastien of Luxembourg, They were born at Maternity Hospital in Luxembourg City.\n\nHonours\nNational\nLuxembourg:\n Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\n Grand Cross of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau\n\nForeign\nAustria: Grand Star  of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria\n Belgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold I\n Brazil: Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross\n Denmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant\n Finland: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n France: Grand Cross of the Order of National Merit\n Greece: Grand Cross of the Order of Beneficence\n Italy: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic\n Japan: Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown\n Latvia: Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Stars\n Netherlands:\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion\nGrand Cross of the Order of the Crown\n Norway: Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Olav\nPortugal-\n Portuguese Royal Family:\nDame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Saint Isabel\n Portugal:\nGrand Cross of the Order of Christ\nGrand Cross of the Order of Saint James of the Sword\nGrand Cross of the Order of Infante Henry\nGrand Cross of the Order of Camões\n Romania: Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania\n Spain: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III\n Sweden:\nMember of the Royal Order of the Seraphim\nCommander Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Polar Star\nRecipient of the 50th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\nThe Mentor Foundation charity website\nPassage 9:\nEdward Buzzell\nEdward Buzzell (November 13, 1895 – January 11, 1985) was an American film actor and director whose credits include Child of Manhattan (1933); Honolulu (1939); the Marx Brothers films At the Circus (1939) and Go West (1940); the musicals Best Foot Forward (1943), Song of the Thin Man (1947), and Neptune's Daughter (1949); and Easy to Wed (1946).\nBorn in Brooklyn, Buzzell appeared in vaudeville and on Broadway, and he was hired to star in the 1929 film version of George M. Cohan's Little Johnny Jones with Alice Day. Buzzell appeared in a few Vitaphone shorts and the two-strip Technicolor short The Devil's Cabaret (1930) as Satan's assistant. He wrote screenplays in the early 1930s and later produced the popular The Milton Berle Show, which premiered on television in 1948.\nIn 1926, Buzzell married actress Ona Munson, who later played Belle Watling in Gone with the Wind. They divorced in 1931. He married socialite Sara Clark on August 11, 1934, but the marriage only lasted five weeks. He married actress Lorraine Miller on December 10, 1949. He died in Los Angeles in 1985 at the age of 89. Buzzell's brother, Samuel Jesse Buzzell, was a music patent attorney in New York City; his daughter (Edward's niece) Gloria Joyce Buzzell was married to Academy Award-winning film producer Harold Hecht, and his son (Edward's nephew) Loring Buzzell was a music publisher and partner in the firm Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music, and was married to singer Lu Ann Simms.\n\nFilmography\nAs Actor\n\nMidnight Life (1928)\nLittle Johnny Jones (1929)\nHello Thar (short, 1930)\nThe Royal Four-Flusher (short, 1930)\nThe Devil's Cabaret (short, 1930)\nThe Lone Star Stranger (short, 1931)\nCheck and Rubber Check (short, 1931)\nShe Served Him Right (short, 1931)\nThe Youngest Profession (1943)\nPassage 10:\nMarie-Louise Coidavid\nQueen Marie Louise Coidavid (1778 – 11 March 1851) was the Queen of the Kingdom of Haiti 1811–20 as the spouse of Henri Christophe.\n\nEarly life\nMarie-Louise was born into a free black family; her father was the owner of Hotel de la Couronne, Cap-Haïtien. Henri Christophe was a slave purchased by her father. Supposedly, he earned enough money in tips from his duties at the hotel that he was able to purchase his freedom before the Haitian Revolution. They married in Cap-Haïtien in 1793, having had a relationship with him from the year prior. They had four children: François Ferdinand (born 1794), Françoise-Améthyste (d. 1831), Athénaïs (d. 1839) and Victor-Henri.\nAt her spouse's new position in 1798, she moved to the Sans-Souci Palace. During the French invasion, she and her children lived underground until 1803.\n\nQueen\nIn 1811, Marie-Louise was given the title of queen upon the creation of the Kingdom of Haiti. Her new status gave her ceremonial tasks to perform, ladies-in-waiting, a secretary and her own court. She took her position seriously, and stated that the title \"given to her by the nation\" also gave her responsibilities and duties to perform. She served as the hostess of the ceremonial royal court life performed at the Sans-Souci Palace. She did not involve herself in the affairs of state. She was given the position of Regent should her son succeed her spouse while still being a minor.  However, as her son became of age before the death of his father, this was never to materialize.After the death of the king in 1820, she remained with her daughters Améthyste and Athénaïs at the palace until they were escorted from it by his followers together with his corpse; after their departure, the palace was attacked and plundered. Marie-Louise and her daughters were given the property Lambert outside Cap. She was visited by president Jean Pierre Boyer, who offered her his protection; he denied the spurs of gold she gave him, stating that he was the leader of poor people. They were allowed to settle in Port-au-Prince. Marie-Louise was described as calm and resigned, but her daughters, especially Athénaïs, were described as vengeful.\n\nExile\nThe Queen was in exile for 30 years. In August 1821, the former queen left Haiti with her daughters under the protection of the British admiral Sir Home Popham, and travelled to London. There were rumours that she was searching for the money, three million, deposited by her spouse in Europe. Whatever the case, she did live the rest of her life without economic difficulties. The English climate and pollution during the Industrial Revolution was determintal to Améthyste's health, and eventually they decided to leave.In 1824, Marie-Louise and her daughters moved in Pisa in Italy, where they lived for the rest of their lives, Améthyste dying shortly after their arrival and Athénaïs in 1839. They lived discreetly for the most part, but were occasionally bothered by fortune hunters and throne claimers who wanted their fortune. Shortly before her death, she wrote to Haiti for permission to return. She never did, however, before she died in Italy. She is buried in the church of San Donnino. A historical marker was installed in front of the church on April 23, 2023 to commemorate the Queen, her daughter and her sister.\n\nSee also\nMarie-Claire Heureuse Félicité\nAdélina Lévêque", "answers": ["Ona Munson"], "length": 10444, "dataset": "2wikimqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8d3cf7916a2f8a2762de13a9520b6350e46464fbf7f63dd5"}

She was married to Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia, in 1166, and became a widow in 1167. In 1171 she was engaged and in February 1177 married to Canute of Denmark in Lund. The couple lived the first years in Skåne. On 12 May 1182, they became king and queen. She did not have any children. During her second marriage, she chose to live in chastity and celibacy with her husband. Arnold of Lübeck remarked of their marriage, that her spouse was: \"The most chaste one, living thus his days with his chaste spouse\" in eternal chastity.\nPassage 3:\nSophia Magdalena of Denmark\nSophia Magdalena of Denmark (Danish: Sophie Magdalene; Swedish: Sofia Magdalena; 3 July 1746 – 21 August 1813) was Queen of Sweden from 1771 to 1792 as the wife of King Gustav III. \nBorn into the House of Oldenburg, the royal family of Denmark-Norway, Sophia Magdalena was the first daughter of King Frederick V of Denmark and Norway and his first consort, Princess Louise of Great Britain. Already at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, as part of an attempt to improve the traditionally tense relationship between the two Scandinavian realms. She was subsequently brought up to be the Queen of Sweden, and they married in 1766. In 1771, Sophia's husband ascended to the throne and became King of Sweden, making Sophia Queen of Sweden. Their coronation was on 29 May 1772.\nThe politically arranged marriage was unsuccessful. The desired political consequences for the mutual relations between the two countries did not materialize, and on a personal level the union also proved to be unhappy. Sophia Magdalena was of a quiet and serious nature, and found it difficult to adjust to her husband's pleasure seeking court. She dutifully performed her ceremonial duties but did not care for social life and was most comfortable in quiet surroundings with a few friends. However, she was liked by many in the Caps party, believing she was a symbol of virtue and religion. The relationship between the spouses improved somewhat in the years from 1775 to 1783, but subsequently deteriorated again.\nAfter her husband was assassinated in 1792, Sophia Magdalena withdrew from public life, and led a quiet life as dowager queen until her death in 1813.\n\nEarly life\nPrincess Sophie Magdalene was born on 3 July 1746 at her parents' residence Charlottenborg Palace, located at the large square, Kongens Nytorv, in central Copenhagen. She was the second child and first daughter of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his first consort, the former Princess Louise of Great Britain, and was named for her grandmother, Queen Sophie Magdalene. She received her own royal household at birth.\nJust one month after her birth, her grandfather King Christian VI died, and Princess Sophie Magdalene's father ascended the throne as King Frederick V. She was the heir presumptive to the throne of Denmark from the death of her elder brother in 1747 until the birth of her second brother in 1749, and retained her status as next in line to the Danish throne after her brother until her marriage. She was therefore often referred to as Crown Princess of Denmark.In the spring of 1751, at the age of five, she was betrothed to Gustav, the heir apparent to the throne of Sweden, and she was brought up to be the Queen of Sweden. The marriage was arranged by the Riksdag of the Estates, not by the Swedish royal family. The marriage was arranged as a way of creating peace between Sweden and Denmark, which had a long history of war and which had strained relations following the election of an heir to the Swedish throne in 1743, where the Danish candidate had lost. The engagement was met with some worry from Queen Louise, who feared that her daughter would be mistreated by the Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. The match was known to be disliked by the Queen of Sweden, who was in constant conflict with the Parliament; and who was known in Denmark for her pride, dominant personality and hatred of anything Danish, which she demonstrated in her treatment of the Danish ambassadors in Stockholm.After the death of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and religious upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate. She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often frightened her when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong phobia.\nIn 1760, the betrothal was again brought up by Denmark, which regarded it as a matter of prestige. The negotiations were made between Denmark and the Swedish Queen, as King Adolf Frederick of Sweden was never considered to be of any more than purely formal importance. Louisa Ulrika favored a match between Gustav and her niece Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt instead, and claimed that she regarded the engagement to be void and forced upon her by Carl Gustaf Tessin. She negotiated with Catherine the Great and her brother Frederick the Great to create some political benefit for Denmark in exchange for a broken engagement. However, the Swedish public was very favorable to the match due to expectations Sophia Magdalena would be like the last Danish-born Queen of Sweden, Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark, who was very loved for her kindness and charity. This view was supported by the Caps political party, which expected Sophia Magdalena to be an example of a virtuous and religious representative of the monarchy in contrast to the haughty Louisa Ulrika. Fredrick V of Denmark was also eager to complete the match: \"His Danish Majesty could not have the interests of his daughter sacrificed because of the prejudices and whims of the Swedish Queen\". In 1764 Crown Prince Gustav, who was at this point eager to free himself from his mother and form his own household, used the public opinion to state to his mother that he wished to honor the engagement, and on 3 April 1766, the engagement was officially celebrated.\nWhen a portrait of Sophia Magdalena was displayed in Stockholm, Louisa Ulrika commented: \"why Gustav, you seem to be already in love with her! She looks stupid\", after which she turned to Prince Charles and added: \"She would suit you better!\"\n\nCrown Princess\nOn 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena was married to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark, as representative of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over Öresund to Hälsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav himself. As she was about to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: \"Watch out, Madame!\", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court.\nThe couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at Stäket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at Säby Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: \"By God, how beautiful she is!\", but that her appearance was affected by the fact that she had a: \"terrible fear of the Queen\". On 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, where she was married to Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace.Sophia Magdalena initially made a good impression upon the Swedish nobility with her beauty, elegance and skillful dance; but her shy, silent, and reserved nature soon made her a disappointment in the society life. Being of a reserved nature, she was considered cold and arrogant. Her mother-in-law Queen Louisa Ulrika, who once stated that she could comprehend nothing more humiliating than the position of a Queen Dowager, harassed her in many ways: a typical example was when she invited Gustav to her birthday celebrations, but asked him to make Sophia Magdalena excuse herself by pretending to be too ill to attend. Louisa Ulrika encouraged a distance between the couple in various ways, and Gustav largely ignored her so as not to make his mother jealous.\nSophia Magdalena was known to be popular with the Caps, who were supported by Denmark, while Louisa Ulrika and Gustav sided with the Hats. The Caps regarded Sophia Magdalena to be a symbol of virtue and religion in a degenerated royal court, and officially demonstrated their support. Sophia Magdalena was advised by the Danish ambassador not to involve herself in politics, and when the spies of Louisa Ulrika reported that Sophia Magdalena received letters from the Danish ambassador through her Danish entourage, the Queen regarded her to be a sympathizer of the Danish-supported Caps: she was isolated from any contact with the Danish embassy, and the Queen encouraged Gustav to force her to send her Danish servants home. This she did not do until 1770, and his demand contributed to their tense and distant relationship. In 1768, Charlotta Sparre tried to reconcile the couple at their summer residence Ekolsund Castle, but the marriage remained unconsummated.After King Adolf Frederick of Sweden died in 1771, Gustav III became King of Sweden. The following year, on 29 May, Sophia Magdalena was crowned Queen.\n\nEarly reign as Queen\nThe coronation of Gustav III and Sophia Magdalena took place on 29 May 1772. She was not informed about the coup of Gustav III, which reinstated absolute monarchy and ended the parliamentary rule of the Estates in the revolution of 1772. At the time she was deemed as suspicious and politically untrustworthy in the eyes of the King, primarily by her mother-in-law, who painted her as pro-Danish. Denmark was presumed to oppose the coup; there were also plans to conquer Norway from Denmark.\nSophia Magdalena was informed about politics nonetheless: she expressed herself pleased with the 1772 parliament because Count Fredrik Ribbing, for whom she had taken an interest, had regained his seat. The conflict between her and her mother-in-law was publicly known and disliked, and the sympathies were on her side. In the contemporary paper Dagligt Allehanda, a fable was presented about Rävinnan och Turturduvan (\"The She Fox and the Turtle Dove\"). The fable was about the innocent turtle dove (Sophia Magdalena) who was slandered by the wicked she fox (Louisa Ulrika), who was supported by the second she fox (Anna Maria Hjärne) and the other foxes (the nobility). The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps party.Queen Sophia Magdalena was of a shy and reserved character, and was never a member of the King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents. In 1777, for example, she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Usually it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the court around her outgoing spouse.As queen, she was expected to do a great deal of representation – more than what had been expected from previous queens due to her husband's adoration of representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to royal court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. For instance, on 17 September 1784, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783–84, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks. During that time, she appeared at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more.\nSophia appeared to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side with only one lady-in-waiting and two footmen, however, her country side visitations were stopped because it was deemed 'unsuitable'. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces: Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von Höpken and Lovisa Meijerfelt, as well as Marianne Ehrenström and Charlotta Cedercreutz, who were known artists.\nSophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: on 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibröder, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.\nIn the famous diary of her sister-in-law, Princess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte, Sophia Magdalena is described as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, very polite and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described her as \"Forced to meet people\".Sophia Magdalena preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, Maria Aurora Uggla and Baroness Virginia Charlotta Manderström, but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational  duties. She frequently visited the theater, and she also had a great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history. She educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian, and regularly read French magazines. According to Augusta von Fersen, Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation.In 1784, after the King had returned from his trip to Italy and France, the relationship between the King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission.\nIn 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him if he took their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him.\nQueen Sophia Magdalena was never involved in politics, except for one on one occasion. In August 1788, during the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), the King gave her the task to enter in negotiations with Denmark to prevent a declaration of war from Denmark during the ongoing war against Russia. He asked her to call upon the Danish ambassador Reventlow and give him a letter to be read in the Danish royal council before her brother, the Danish King. He gave her the freedom to write as she wished, but to use the argument that she spoke as a sister and mother to a son with the right to the Danish throne and upon her own initiative.\nSophia Magdalena called upon the Danish ambassador, held a speech to him followed by a long conversation and then handed him a letter written as a \"warm appeal\" to her brother. A copy was sent to Gustav III, and her letter was read in the royal Danish council, where it reportedly made a good impression. However, her mission was still unsuccessful, as the Russo-Danish alliance made it unavoidable for Denmark to declare war shortly afterward. At the time, there was a note that she met two Russian prisoners of war in the park of the Haga Palace, and gave them 100 kronor each.\n\nAt the parliament of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility and to gain support for the war and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act led to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of Jeanna von Lantingshausen as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, Sophie Albertine of Sweden and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways than what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window. She was known to dislike the reforms of 1789, and she did let it be known to its representatives. At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksråd Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.\nIn the autumn of 1790, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of Drottningholm Palace well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent. He accused her of having been manipulated by the female courtiers into participating in the political demonstration, and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving. This applied especially to Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie and Augusta von Fersen, who did not participate in the boycott: he suspected Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however is not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak of politics in her presence. The reason to why she wished to leave was reportedly due to her health, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an ear infection. The King did in any case suspect her of being in political opposition to him, and before his trip to Aachen in 1791, he ordered that his son was to be separated from her during his absence abroad. When she was made aware of this, Sophia Magdalena caused a public scene when she visited him in his box at the opera and demanded to be given access to her son. This led to a heated argument and she left the box with the words: \"I will have my vengeance, monsieur! I give you my sacred vow on that!\"\n\nSuccession issues\nSophia Magdalena is mostly known in Swedish history for the scandal created around the consummation of her marriage and the questioned legitimacy of her son. Her marriage was a then normal arranged royal match for political convenience, in which Sophia Magdalena at first was described by her spouse as \"cold as ice\". Sophia Magdalena's religious upbringing and introverted character made her avoid the lively and spontaneous Gustavian court life, which made her even less attractive in the eyes of her outgoing spouse.Their marriage was not consummated until 1775, nine years after the wedding. The status quo between Gustav III and his consort was nurtured by the Queen Dowager, Louisa Ulrika, who did not want competition in her influence over her son. There were rumors that the King was a homosexual or sexually underdeveloped. His sexuality, which had much effect on Sophia Magdalena's life, as a royal marriage was designed to produce offspring, has been much debated. His sexual inexperience has been blamed on immaturity or him also being asexual.\nAs a teenager, Gustav had a crush on Axel von Fersen's mother, Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie, though this affection was never physical. In 1768, he had another infatuation with the noble Charlotte Du Rietz, but this is not believed to have been sexually consummated either. Various documents written during his lifetime alleged that he was bisexual or homosexual.\nHis sister-in-law, Princess Charlotte, claims that the King did participate in homosexual activity after his trip to Italy in 1784 and that there were several rumors about this: she claims that she herself had witnessed that the park at Drottningholm Palace had become a place where male courtiers searched for homosexual partners, and in a letter to Sophie von Fersen, she writes in code: \n\n\"It is said that the King recently attacked a young man in the park at night and offered him the post of chamberlain to the Queen if he agreed to his lusts, but the young man preferred to leave. Agree that this is to take things too far. It is said that the trips to Svartsjö Palace are made to be provide privacy, it is unbelievable, but it is what it is said. I could tell you a million things about this.\"\nIn 1791, Sophia Magdalena herself paid a surprise visit to the King during his stay at the Gustav III's Pavilion, where the King had spent more time since he came in conflict with the nobility after the 1789 parliament; and where he was reputed to indulge in orgies. She found the King in bed, and he asked one of his favorites, Count Fabian Wrede, to show her around. In the King's private chamber, however, the Queen found the actor and page of the King, Lars Hjortsberg, sleeping, naked. The Queen reacted by interrupting the tour by saying to Wrede that he apparently did not know his way around Haga, as he had obviously showed her the chamber of the staff rather than the King by mistake.Some sources explain that both the Queen and the King had serious anatomical problems resulting in erotic complications. Erik Lönnroth has concluded that there is no factual proof for the rumors that Gustav III was inclined toward homosexuality or bisexuality, nor that Gustav Adolf was illegitimate.\nDuring the Coup of Gustav III on 19 August 1772, Sophia Magdalena was at Ekolsund Castle. After having been told of the successful coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hjärne, that she was afraid that she would now be divorced by Gustav, because she knew she was not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because she knew she was being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, that he did plan to divorce her on the grounds of pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksråd Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. Von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made her laugh, among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hjärne. Countess Hjärne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant, \"And the riksråd Ribbing is her favorite.\"The King had given Countess Ulrica Catharina Stromberg the task to investigate this, and she was told by the chamber madame of Sophia Magdalena, Charlotta Hellman, that: \"information, which where dubious, especially since the clearest evidence could be gathered from the linen of the Queen\". Her contact with Rosencrone is said to have been restricted to the fact that he handled her correspondence with Denmark. After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.\nIn 1774, the King arranged the marriage between his brother, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, and Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, to solve, for the time being, the immediate question of an heir to the throne. The Duchess had false pregnancies and miscarriages only, which may have hastened the King to expedite the consummation of his own marriage and produce a son of his own.\nIn 1778, Sophia Magdalena gave birth to Gustav Adolf, successor to the throne, and in 1782, she gave birth to a second son, Charles Gustav, who only lived for one year. It was suggested in some circles that King Gustav's first son was sired by someone else. When the heir was born, the father was believed, by the Queen Dowager among others, to be Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila, then Riksstallmästare. This rumor was believed by elements of the public and the royal court, and her acquiescence to it led to a year-long break between the Queen Dowager and her son.\n\nSuccession scandal\nThe King, claiming to be sexually inexperienced, called upon Munck to help him with a reconciliation with his spouse, instruct the couple in the ways of sexual intercourse, and physically show them how to consummate their marriage. Munck, a Finnish nobleman and, at the time, a stable master was, at that point, the lover of Anna Sofia Ramström, the Queen's chamber maid. Through Anna Sofia Ramström, Munck contacted Ingrid Maria Wenner, who was assigned to inform the queen of the king's wish, because she was married and the confidant of the queen. Munck and Ramström were to be present in a room close to the bedchamber, ready to be of assistance when needed, and he was, at some points, called into the bedchamber. Munck himself writes in his written account, which is preserved at the National Archives of Sweden, that to succeed, he was obliged to touch them both physically.When it became known that Munck participated in the reconciliation between the royal couple, there were rumours that he was the father of Sophia Magdalena's firstborn.These became the subject of accusations from the political opposition, as late as in 1786 and 1789,: 132  where it was claimed that the whole nation was aware of the rumour that the King had asked Munck to make the Queen pregnant.: 118  Pamphlets to that end were posted on street corners all over Stockholm.: 143 This was also caricatured by Carl August Ehrensvärd in private letters discovered later – his drawing was published in 1987 —, where he passed on a number of rumors and jokes about Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena and Munck without inferring that he believed they were true. There was also a rumour that the King and Queen had divorced in secret and that the Queen had married Munck.There is no proof that Munck was the father of the crown prince. Erik Lönnroth has suggested that the anatomical problems mentioned in Munck's account, known only to a few initiated persons, were the primary factor in their delay in producing an heir. At the time, the rumors became more persistent, however, when the royal couple presented Munck with gifts: the King promoted him, and the Queen gave Munck a pension, a diamond ring, and a watch with her image.A few socialites took the Queen Mother's side in supporting and spreading the rumors, such as Anna Charlotta Schröderheim and Eva Helena Löwen.The circle around the King's brother, Duke Charles, the future Charles XIII of Sweden, who desired the throne, also encouraged these rumors. Their mother was quoted as saying, during the pregnancy of Sophia Magdalena, that there were rumors among the public that the future child was illegitimate, and that she herself believed that the King had hired Munck to impregnate the Queen, and that she would never accept that the throne would come into the hands of \"a common nobleman's illegitimate offspring\".: 103–4 The Queen Mother ordered Duke Charles to interrogate Munck, and word spread to the King, who was shocked. Sophia Magdalena was equally shocked by the accusations. She swore she would never speak to the Queen Dowager again, and indeed she never did.\nThe King arranged for his mother to make a public apology for her accusation in the presence of the rest of the Royal Family the 12 May 1778. The scene gained a lot of attention and broke the bonds between Gustav III and his mother. The scandal disturbed celebrations, as did an accident with the public banquet. The public was invited to a great feast to celebrate the birth of the heir, but too many people were let in, and the crowd panicked. Between sixty and one hundred people were trampled to death in the crowd.\nSven Anders Hedin, a medical doctor at the royal court, and married to one of the Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two statements which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom.  To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor on his way to the Queen's bedchamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: \"In nine months, I will be able to answer exactly!\" in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned.\nIn 1782, Sophia Magdalena had a second son. After the death of her younger son in 1783, her marriage deteriorated. In May 1784, Sophia Magdalena is believed to have had a miscarriage, and after this, there are no further notes of any pregnancies. A brief reconciliation in 1787 was deemed by Duchess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte in her diaries as temporary, with no hope of being complete and lasting,: 191  as the King was not \"receptive to female charm\": another insinuation that he was homosexual.\nIn 1787, Sophia Magdalena deposited a sum of 50.000 riksdaler in an account for Munck, which was generally rumoured to be a \"farewell gift\".: 156–7   At this point, Munck had started an affair with the ballerina Giovanna Bassi, to whom Sophia Magdalena showed great dislike.: 157   The King was terrified when he heard that the Queen had made that deposit, and he tried to prevent the transaction from becoming public knowledge, which, however, did not succeed.: 157  Munck was, however, continued to be used as a go-between and a messenger between the King and the Queen, especially during conflicts.\nA child of Giovanna Bassi's, rumored to be the child of Munck, bore a strong likeness to the Crown Prince.\n\nQueen Dowager\nOn 16 March 1792 Gustav III was attacked and mortally wounded. Sophia Magdalena was reportedly shocked and horrified by the attack. The conspirators intended to make her the regent of her son during his minority.: 443  As a Guardian government had been necessary by putting a minor monarch on the throne, their plan was to offer this role to Sophia Magdalena by taking military control and offering the Queen dowager the role of presiding over the guardian council instead of her brother-in-law Duke Charles. Directly after she was told of the attack, Sophia Magdalena sent for the king's favorite, Gustav Mauritz Armfelt, and was taken by him to the sick bed of the King. There, she took the hands of the King between hers and cried out to Armfelt: \"How horrifying! Such a cruel atrocity!\" She was kept informed of his state by Armfelt, but she was prevented from further visits because Gustav did not wish to receive visits from women because of the smell from his wounds. At the death of Gustav III 29 March 1792, she attempted to visit him, but she was blocked by her brother-in-law Duke Charles, who fell on his knees before her to stop her from entering the bed room.\nSophia Magdalena caused a scandal as it was noted that she did not dress in mourning except when she was forced to do so at visits and on formal occasions.: 442   This criticism was likely worsened because she was exposed to some suspicions, as it was known that the conspirators had planned to make her regent.\nAs Queen Dowager, it was a relief to Sophia Magdalena to withdraw from public life. Her brother-in-law, Duke Charles, became regent, and she eschewed a political role. As a widow, Sophia Magdalena lived a withdrawn life. She did not wish to take part in any representational duties, and she gave up her quarters at Drottningholm Palace to be relieved of them. She lived in the Royal Palace in Stockholm during the winter, and at Ulriksdal Palace during the summer. She lived in a circle of her own court, and seldom entertained any guests other than her lifelong friends Maria Aurora Uggla and Virginia Manderström. It is noted that, although she had hated the male favorites of her spouse during his lifetime, she gave several of them positions in her court as a widow. Sophia Magdalena had a close relationship with her son, King Gustav IV Adolf, who visited her regularly and with whom she shared an interest in religion.\n\nIn 1797, she insisted on skipping the protocol at the reception of her daughter-in-law, Frederica of Baden. The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not greet her daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace with the rest of the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: \"I know myself how I suffered, when I arrived to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. As for my daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!\" During the reign of her son, she seldom showed herself at court except on Sundays and at court presentations, and preferred to stay at her estate. She regularly met her son and his family on family visits, but she did not participate in court life.\nIn 1809 she witnessed the coup and following abdication of her son, King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, after Sweden lost Finland to Russia. She was deeply affected by his deposition. On the day of the coup, she was informed by her friend Maria Aurora Uggla, and in her company she immediately rushed to the quarters of her son. She was prevented from seeing him by guards, and burst into tears in the arms of Uggla. Shortly after, she was visited in her quarters by Duke Charles in the company of guards, who officially told her what had happened and made her burst into tears again by officially banning her from seeing her son. When she, during the captivity of her son, formally applied for permission to see him, and was told by Charles that she could not unless given permission by the government, she publicly commented: \"The government was not asked for permission for the murder of my husband, neither any permission was sought to depose and imprison my son, but I must have their permission, to speak to my child.\" She was never to see her son again, but she corresponded with him for the rest of her life. He was sent into exile and replaced by his paternal uncle Charles XIII, but she remained in Sweden until her death. She did, however, say goodbye to her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren when they left Stockholm to join Gustav Adolf.\nIn January 1810, she was presented to the elected heir to the throne, Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she was presented to the next elected heir to the throne, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: \"I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believes that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit of dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!\" At the meeting, her face was said to have turned white, but at the end, she is said to have been delighted by his charm. In 1811, she was one of the few in the Swedish Court who were nice to Désirée Clary.\nIn September 1812, Germaine de Staël was presented to her, and gave her the impression of her: \"Her Majesty analyzed my books as an educated woman, whose judgement showed as much thoroughness as well as delicate feeling. Never has any one impressed me such as your Queen! I almost dared not reply to her, so taken was I by the royal glory around her – it gave me such respect, that I shivered!\" When the Crown Prince banned any contact between Swedes and the former royal family, Germaine de Staël asked that an exception was to be made for Sophia Magdalena, and it was: her letters were however read by foreign minister Lars von Engeström.\n\nLater life and death\nSophia Magdalena lived more isolated towards the end of her life and was affected by worsened health. From 1812, she devoted much of her time to her friendship with the young amateur botanic Baron Anton Fredrik Wrangel. She never fully recovered after having suffered a stroke in May 1813.\n\nChildren\nIn popular culture\nThe affair of the consummation of her marriage and the succession scandal was portrayed in SVT's period drama production of \"Gustav III:s äktenskap\" (The Marriage of Gustav III) in 2001, where Sophia Magdalena was portrayed by Danish actress Iben Hjejle.\nIt was also used to inspire the novel Drottningens juvelsmycke, famous in Sweden, where the character of Tintomara is portrayed as a half sibling of Gustav IV Adolf through Count Munck.\n\nAncestry\nInline references\nBibliographic references\nAlm, Mikael (2003–2006).

It has a screenplay by Eugene Hess, based on a story by Hess and Dennis Fanning. The film was produced by Nu Image/Millennium Films.\n\nPlot\nDuring the rage of Hurricane Katrina, Detective Andy Devereaux (Val Kilmer) discovers the body of his former partner in a warehouse. Quickly forgetting about his discovery, he joins a newly transferred detective named Stan Johnson (Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson) trying to end a conflict involving looters.\nPost-Katrina, Andy and Stan are now partners. They work with corrupt detectives Pepe (Jose Pablo Cantillo) and Barney (Brian Presley), who are caught up in the murder of an undercover narcotics agent. Investigating the escalating police corruption in New Orleans is FBI Agent Brown (Michael Biehn). Brown brings up his thoughts to Police Captain Friendly (Barry Shabaka Henley) who insists he is doing his best to solve the problems in his department.\nMeanwhile, police therapist Nina Ferraro (Sharon Stone) tries to help the detectives with their struggles, with little avail. She is particularly interested in Andy, whose father, also a detective, was murdered in the line of duty.\nThings are complicated further with Agent Brown's investigation into Andy and his crew. Brown tells Andy that he has an informant who is leaking out the details, and Andy, disbelieving at first, begins to resign himself to the fact that one of his men is betraying him.\nAfter Captain Friendly is assassinated by a local gangster named Chamorro, Andy, Stan, Pepe, and Barney decide to take the law into their own hands and go after Chamorro. While interrogating Chamorro, they find out that Brown has been supplying the drug dealer with information about the police raids, to help his own investigation. In a violent shootout, Barney accidentally shoots and kills Pepe.\nAndy and Stan escape, only to return to the warehouse where they met. There Andy realizes that Stan is the informant. After the two start arguing, Brown shows up and there is another shootout, ending in Brown's death. Andy comforts a sobbing Stan, then Andy kills his partner, as he possibly did with his previous one.\nThe film ends on a low note, leaving no premise about Andy's future.\n\nCast\nCurtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson as Stan Johnson\nVal Kilmer as Andy Devereaux\nSharon Stone as Nina Ferraro\nMichael Biehn as Agent Michael Brown/Drug Dealer\nJose Pablo Cantillo as Pepe\nBrian Presley as Barney\nBarry Shabaka Henley as Capt.

Henri Christophe was a slave purchased by her father. Supposedly, he earned enough money in tips from his duties at the hotel that he was able to purchase his freedom before the Haitian Revolution. They married in Cap-Haïtien in 1793, having had a relationship with him from the year prior. They had four children: François Ferdinand (born 1794), Françoise-Améthyste (d. 1831), Athénaïs (d. 1839) and Victor-Henri.\nAt her spouse's new position in 1798, she moved to the Sans-Souci Palace. During the French invasion, she and her children lived underground until 1803.\n\nQueen\nIn 1811, Marie-Louise was given the title of queen upon the creation of the Kingdom of Haiti. Her new status gave her ceremonial tasks to perform, ladies-in-waiting, a secretary and her own court. She took her position seriously, and stated that the title \"given to her by the nation\" also gave her responsibilities and duties to perform. She served as the hostess of the ceremonial royal court life performed at the Sans-Souci Palace. She did not involve herself in the affairs of state. She was given the position of Regent should her son succeed her spouse while still being a minor.  However, as her son became of age before the death of his father, this was never to materialize.After the death of the king in 1820, she remained with her daughters Améthyste and Athénaïs at the palace until they were escorted from it by his followers together with his corpse; after their departure, the palace was attacked and plundered. Marie-Louise and her daughters were given the property Lambert outside Cap. She was visited by president Jean Pierre Boyer, who offered her his protection; he denied the spurs of gold she gave him, stating that he was the leader of poor people. They were allowed to settle in Port-au-Prince. Marie-Louise was described as calm and resigned, but her daughters, especially Athénaïs, were described as vengeful.\n\nExile\nThe Queen was in exile for 30 years. In August 1821, the former queen left Haiti with her daughters under the protection of the British admiral Sir Home Popham, and travelled to London. There were rumours that she was searching for the money, three million, deposited by her spouse in Europe. Whatever the case, she did live the rest of her life without economic difficulties. The English climate and pollution during the Industrial Revolution was determintal to Améthyste's health, and eventually they decided to leave.In 1824, Marie-Louise and her daughters moved in Pisa in Italy, where they lived for the rest of their lives, Améthyste dying shortly after their arrival and Athénaïs in 1839. They lived discreetly for the most part, but were occasionally bothered by fortune hunters and throne claimers who wanted their fortune. Shortly before her death, she wrote to Haiti for permission to return. She never did, however, before she died in Italy. She is buried in the church of San Donnino. A historical marker was installed in front of the church on April 23, 2023 to commemorate the Queen, her daughter and her sister.\n\nSee also\nMarie-Claire Heureuse Félicité\nAdélina Lévêque\nPassage 6:\nPrincess Auguste of Bavaria (1875–1964)\nPrincess Auguste of Bavaria (German: Auguste Maria Luise Prinzessin von Bayern; 28 April 1875 – 25 June 1964) was a member of the Bavarian Royal House of Wittelsbach and the spouse of Archduke Joseph August of Austria.\n\nBirth and family\nAuguste was born in Munich, Bavaria, the second child of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and his wife, Archduchess Gisela of Austria.

She is also the granddaughter of Agustín Batista y González de Mendoza, who was the founder of the Trust Company of Cuba, the most powerful Cuban bank prior to the Cuban Revolution.In October 1959, at the time of the Cuban Revolution, Maria Teresa Mestre’s parents left Cuba with their children, because the new government headed by Fidel Castro confiscated their properties. The family settled in New York City,  where as a young girl she was a pupil at Marymount School. From 1961 she carried on her studies at the Lycée Français de New York. In her childhood, Maria Teresa Mestre took ballet and singing courses. She practices skiing, ice-skating and water sports. She later lived in Santander, Spain, and in Geneva, Switzerland, where she became a Swiss citizen.In 1980, Maria Teresa graduated from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva with a degree in political sciences. While studying there, she met her future husband Henri of Luxembourg.\n\nSocial and humanitarian interests\nSoon after her marriage, Maria Teresa and the then Hereditary Grand Duke Henri established The Prince Henri and Princess Maria Teresa Foundation to help those with special needs integrate fully into society. In 2001, she and her husband created The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess Foundation, launched upon the accession of the couple as the new Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. In 2004, the Grand Duke Henri and the Grand Duchess Maria Teresa Foundation was created after the merging of the two previous foundations.\nIn 1997, Maria Teresa was made a special ambassador for UNESCO, working to expand education for young girls and women and help to fight poverty.Since 2005, Maria Teresa has been the chairwoman of the international jury of the European Microfinance Award, which annually awards holders of microfinance and inclusive finance initiatives in developing countries. Also, since 2006, Maria Teresa has been honorary president of the LuxFLAG (Luxembourg Fund Labeling Agency), the first agency to label responsible microfinance investment funds around the world.On 19 April 2007, the Grand Duchess was appointed UNICEF Eminent Advocate for Children, in which role she has visited Brazil (2007), China (2008), and Burundi (2009).She is a member of the Honorary Board of the International Paralympic Committee and a patron of the Ligue Luxembourgeoise de Prévention et d’Action medico-sociales and SOS Villages d’Enfants Monde. The Grand Duchess and her husband Grand Duke Henri are the members of the Mentor Foundation (London), created under the patronage of the World Health Organization. She is also the president of the Luxembourg Red Cross and the Cancer Foundation. In 2016, she organized the first international forum on learning disabilities in Luxembourg.The Grand Duchess supports the UNESCO “Breaking the Poverty Cycle of Women” project in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. The purpose of this project is to improve the living conditions of girls, women and their families. As honorary president of her own foundation, Grand Duchess Maria Teresa set up a project called Projet de la Main Tendue after visiting the Bujumbura prison in 2009 in Burundi. The purpose of this project is to liberate minor people from prison and to give them new opportunities for their future.\nIn October 2016, Maria Teresa accepted an invitation to join the eminent international Council of Patrons of the Asian University for Women (AUW) in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The university, which is the product of east-west foundational partnerships (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Open Society Foundation, IKEA Foundation, etc.) and regional cooperation, serves extraordinarily talented women from 15 countries across Asia and the Middle East.In 2019, Maria Teresa presented her initiative \"Stand Speak Rise Up!\" to end sexual violence in fragile environments, launched in cooperation with the Women’s Forum and with the support of the Luxembourg government. The conference is in partnership with the Dr. Denis Mukwege Foundation and We Are Not Weapons of War.In 2020 the Prime Minister of Luxembourg commissioned a report into the Cour le Grand Ducal following concerns over its working. The report found that up to 1/3 of employees had left since 2015 and that \"The most important decisions in the field of personnel management, whether at the level of recruitment, assignment to the various departments or even at the dismissal level are taken by HRH the Grand Duchess.” Several newspaper reports at the time highlighted a 'culture of fear' around the Grand Duchess and \"that no-one bar the Prime Minister dared confront her\". The report also raised concerns about the use of public funds to pay for the Grand Duchess' personal website and that this had been prioritised over the Cour's own official website. There were also allegations that staff at the Court has been subject to physical abuse and these reports were investigated by the Luxembourg judicial police.\nIn February 2023 it was reported by several Luxembourg based media that the Grand Duchess had once again been accused of treating staff poorly during an outfit fitting in October 22. The incident even involved the Prime Minister of Luxembourg having to speak to the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess about the treatment of the staff and commissioning a report into it.\n\nFamily\nMaria Teresa married Prince Henri of Luxembourg in a civil ceremony on 4 February 1981 and a religious ceremony on 14 February 1981, since Valentine's Day was their favourite holiday. The consent of the Grand Duke had been previously given on 7 November 1980. She received a bouquet of red roses and a sugarcane as a wedding gift from Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. The couple has five children: Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Prince Félix of Luxembourg, Prince Louis of Luxembourg, Princess Alexandra of Luxembourg, and Prince Sébastien of Luxembourg, They were born at Maternity Hospital in Luxembourg City.\n\nHonours\nNational\nLuxembourg:\n Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\n Grand Cross of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau\n\nForeign\nAustria: Grand Star  of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria\n Belgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold I\n Brazil: Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross\n Denmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant\n Finland: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n France: Grand Cross of the Order of National Merit\n Greece: Grand Cross of the Order of Beneficence\n Italy: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic\n Japan: Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown\n Latvia: Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Stars\n Netherlands:\nKnight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion\nGrand Cross of the Order of the Crown\n Norway: Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Olav\nPortugal-\n Portuguese Royal Family:\nDame Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Saint Isabel\n Portugal:\nGrand Cross of the Order of Christ\nGrand Cross of the Order of Saint James of the Sword\nGrand Cross of the Order of Infante Henry\nGrand Cross of the Order of Camões\n Romania: Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania\n Spain: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III\n Sweden:\nMember of the Royal Order of the Seraphim\nCommander Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Polar Star\nRecipient of the 50th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\nThe Mentor Foundation charity website\nPassage 10:\nHeather D.

She was the spouse of Euclid Tsakalotos, former Greek Minister of Finance.\n\nAcademic career\nBefore assuming her duties at the Bank of Greece and alternating child-rearing duties with her husband, Gibson worked at the University of Kent, where she published two volumes on international exchange rate mechanisms and wrote numerous articles on this and other topics, sometimes in cooperation with her husband, who was teaching at Kent at the time.\n\nPersonal life\nGibson first came to Greece in 1993, with her husband, with whom she took turns away from their respective economic studies to raise their three children while the other worked.The couple maintain two homes in Kifisia, along with an office in Athens and a vacation home in Preveza. In 2013, this proved detrimental to Tsakalotos and his party when his critics began calling him «αριστερός αριστοκράτης» (aristeros aristokratis, \"aristocrat of the left\"), while newspapers opposed to the Syriza party seized on his property holdings as a chance to accuse the couple of hypocrisy for enjoying a generous lifestyle in private while criticizing the \"ethic of austerity\" in public. One opposition newspaper published on the front page criticism reasoning that Tsakalotos own family wealth came from the same sort of investments in companies as made by financial institutions JP Morgan and BlackRock.\n\nWorks\nEditor\nEconomic Bulletin, Bank of Greece\n\nBooks\nThe Eurocurrency Markets, Domestic Financial Policy and International Instability (London, etc., Longman: 1989) ISBN 0312028261\nInternational Finance: Exchange Rates and Financial Flows in the International Financial System (London, etc., Longman: 1996) ISBN 0582218136\nEconomic Transformation, Democratization and Integration into the European Union (London: Palgrave Macmillan: 2001) ISBN 9780333801222\n\nArticles and papers\n\"Fundamentally Wrong: Market Pricing of Sovereigns and the Greek Financial Crisis,\" Journal of Macroeconomics, Elsevier, vol. 39(PB), pp. 405–419 (with Stephen G. & Tavlas, George S., 2014)\n\"Capital flows and speculative attacks in prospective EU member states\" (with Euclid Tsakalotos, Economics of Transition Volume 12, Issue 3, pages 559–586, September 2004)\n\"A Unifying Framework for Analysing Offsetting Capital Flows and Sterilisation: Germany and the ERM\" (with Sophocles Brissimis & Euclid Tsakalotos, International Journal of Finance & Economics, 2002, vol. 7, issue 1, pp. 63–78)\n\"Internal vs External Financing of Acquisitions: Do Managers Squander Retained Profits\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, Studies in Economics, 1996; Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 2000)\n\"Are Aggregate Consumption Relationships Similar Across the European Union\" (with Alan Carruth & Euclid Tsakalotos, Regional Studies, Volume 33, Issue 1, 1999)\nTakeover Risk and the Market for Corporate Control: The Experience of British Firms in the 1970s and 1980 (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, 1998) PDF\n\"The Impact of Acquisitions on Company Performance: Evidence from a Large Panel of UK Firms\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, Oxford Economic Papers New Series, Vol. 49, No. 3 (Jul., 1997), pp. 344–361)\n\"Short-Termism and Underinvestment: The Influence of Financial Systems\" (with Andrew Dickerson and Euclid Tsakalotos, The Manchester School of Economic & Social Studies, 1995, vol. 63, issue 4, pp. 351–67)\n\"Testing a Flow Model of Capital Flight in Five European Countries\" (with Euclid Tsakalotos, The Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies, Volume 61, Issue 2, pp. 144–166, June 1993)\nFull list of articles by Heather D Gibson. researchgate.net.

When an earthquake causes the toxic waste to spill, Catherine Valmont, a young woman who died several years ago, is resurrected. She viciously kills the thieves and drinks their blood. As Catherine walks aimlessly through a field, Barbara spots her and takes a few photos, though Barbara's boyfriend, Greg, takes no notice. Catherine returns to her old house, the Valmont Mansion, and memories of her childhood come back to her, especially her childhood friend, Hélène. As Catherine wanders the house, a real estate agent shows an old couple around the property, though they show little interest. After they leave, Hélène calls the house, presumably inquiring about it. However, she hears nothing but a cherished music box, leading her to believe that Catherine may still be alive.\nThe agent later returns to the Valmont Mansion, along with her boyfriend. Catherine interrupts them having sex, killing both and drinking their blood. Hélène arrives and is shocked to discover the dead bodies. When she finds Catherine, naked and playing the piano, she assumes that Catherine didn't really die but was actually hidden for the past two years. Hélène washes the blood off Catherine, puts her to bed, and drags the bodies down to the crypt, where she discovers the bodies of the grave robbers. Catherine creeps down and begins to drink the blood from one of the bodies, but Hélène stops her. Hélène cuts her arm and lets Catherine drink her blood, until she can think of a way to supply her friend with blood.\nBarbara goes around the village asking about the woman in her photograph, but the answer is always the same: It is Catherine Valmont, and she died two years ago. Greg thinks Barbara is making too much of it, and discourages her from investigating further. Meanwhile, Hélène tries to understand what is happening to Catherine, trying to teach her to speak again. Deciding to bring her victims, Hélène pretends to be out of fuel and flags down a helpful motorist, drawing her back to the mansion. Hélène offers the woman a drink and locks her in. The woman soon begins to panic, but Hélène throws her in the crypt, where Catherine grabs her and rips her stomach out. Soon after, Barbara shows up at the Valmont mansion, seeking Catherine. Unsettled by Catherine's behavior, she attempts to phone Greg, but Hélène confronts her. They argue, and Hélène tries to take Barbara's camera. Barbara flees.\nCatherine, now more in touch with her humanity, realizes that she must be destroyed. She begs Hélène to kill her, but Hélène instead goes back to the village, to bring Catherine another victim. Barbara sees Hélène and eventually convinces Greg to accompany her to the mansion, in order to help Catherine. Hélène tortures the kidnapped girl, but Catherine rejects the unwilling sacrifice and frees her, telling her to return to the village and seek help. Drawn by the screams, Barbara and Greg go to investigate, but they are brutally murdered by Hélène. Overwhelmed by all the death and murder, Catherine attempts suicide, but she is rescued by Hélène, who offers herself to sate Catherine's hunger. Unable to resist, Catherine devours her friend alive.\n\nCast\nMarina Pierro as Hélène\nFrançoise Blanchard as Catherine Valmont (\"The Living Dead Girl\")\nMike Marshall as Greg\nCarina Barone as Barbara Simon\nFanny Magiere as 6th Victim (as Fanny Magieri)\nPatricia Besnard-Rousseau\nVéronique Pinson (as Veronique Pinson)\nSandrine Morel as Teenage Catherine Valmont\nSam Selsky as Old American man in the house of Catherine\n\nProduction\nRollin originally sought Italian actress Teresa Ann Savoy for the title role, but when she met him, Savoy said she would never work with Rollin under any circumstances. Instead, Blanchard was cast. She found the shooting to be physically exhausting and collapsed on the set. Blanchard's performance in the ending scene in which Catherine devours Hélène and descends into madness was so believable that the crew were worried for her mental state, thinking that she had in fact gone mad.\nRollin met Pierro at the Sitges Film Festival, casting her for her strong personality, but finding her vain.\n\nRelease\nThe original release was 25 August 1982. Alternate titles included The Living Dead Girl, Lady Dracula, Queen Zombie and Scare: Dead or Alive.\n\nCensorship\nLa morte vivante was banned in Germany in 1986 for its explicit scenes of violence and gore. The film was released direct-to-video in the United Kingdom in 1994; however, most of these scenes were removed or shortened by the BBFC in order for the film to pass with an 18 certificate. A scene in which Catherine impales a woman's throat which her sharp fingernail was edited; one in which a female victim is disemboweled by Catherine was slightly cut to remove some of the prolonged gore; a scene in which Hélène slashes at a teenage girl's navel area was completely removed; the ending scene where Catherine eats Hélène alive was somewhat trimmed down; and the shot where Hélène's thumb is bitten off was cut. Some of these scenes were waived for the 2000 release, which also premiered on UK television for the first time in 2005 when it was screened on The Horror Channel. The film was eventually passed uncut in the UK in 2007.\n\nReception\nBloody Disgusting rated the Blu-ray release 3 out of 5, saying that the film has plenty of flaws but is worth watching.\n\nHome media\nIn the United States, La morte vivante was initially released on DVD in an edited version on 9 November 1999, and was available in a \"Widescreen Edition\" via Image Entertainment and Redemption. It was re-released on DVD, complete and uncut for the first time, on 25 October 2010 by Redemption. Kino Lorber and Redemption released a Blu-ray version, as well as a remastered DVD on 7 August 2012, featuring an intro by Rollin, several featurettes and interviews, and a 12-page booklet.In the United Kingdom, the film was first made available on VHS format in a direct-to-video release in 1994. It was issued on DVD on 2 May 2000, followed by a reissued VHS version on 8 May 2000. The DVD contained a cropped 4:3 aspect ratio, which was a transfer from the original video release and reversible cover artwork. Redemption released two subsequent DVD editions in the UK, the first on 3 September 2007, presenting the film complete and uncensored for the first time. The second was released on 18 May 2015, containing newly commissioned artwork.La morte vivante, under the title The Living Dead Girl, received a Blu-ray release in the UK in 2018. Released by Black House Films, this version of the film has a 1:78:1 aspect ratio.\nThe complete uncut version was released by Encore in Europe on 30 November 2005 in a 2-DVD set with a new aspect ratio of 16:9/1.78:1. The special features included introductions by Blanchard (in French with English subtitles) and Rollin, selected scenes commentary by Blanchard (in French with English subtitles), a bonus soundtrack CD, a 64-page essay booklet, and interviews (all in French with English subtitles) with Blanchard, Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and composer Philippe d'Aram.\nPassage 3:\nLa Morte\nLa Morte (French pronunciation: ​[la mɔʁt]) is a commune in the Isère department in southeastern France.\n\nPopulation\nSee also\nCommunes of the Isère department\nPassage 4:\nJacques Tourneur\nJacques Tourneur (French: [tuʁnœʁ]; November 12, 1904 – December 19, 1977) was a French film director known for the classic film noir Out of the Past and a series of low-budget horror films he made for RKO Radio Pictures by Val Lewton, including Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and The Leopard Man. He is also known for directing Night of the Demon, which was released by Columbia Pictures. While in Hollywood, he was usually addressed by his anglicized name \"Jack Turner\", a literal and phonetic translation of his name in English.\n\nLife\nBorn in Paris, France, Tourneur was the son of Fernande Petit and film director Maurice Tourneur. At age 10, Jacques moved to the United States with his father. He started a career in cinema while still attending high school as an extra and later as a script clerk in various silent films. Both Maurice and Jacques returned to France after his father worked on the film The Mysterious Island in 1925. Tourneur died in 1977, aged 73, in Bergerac, Dordogne, France.\n\nCareer\nTourneur began work as an editor and assistant director. He made his debut as a director on the French film Tout ça ne vaut pas l'amour in 1931. Tourneur went to Hollywood in 1934 where he had a contract with MGM Studios. While working as the second unit director on the film A Tale of Two Cities he met film producer Val Lewton.Tourneur made his feature debut as director in the 1939 film They All Come Out. After Tourneur was dropped by MGM in 1941, he was picked up by Lewton to film several acclaimed low-budget horror films for RKO Studios including Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie.Cat People, although considered a B movie and made on a limited budget, was distinguished by a style of lighting and cinematography that has been imitated countless times. Tourneur was promoted to the A-list at RKO, directing films including Out of the Past and Berlin Express. In the 1950s, Tourneur became a freelance director, filming various genre films including Wichita, Anne of the Indies, Way of a Gaucho, Nightfall, The Flame and the Arrow, Stars In My Crown and Night of the Demon. His last two films, made for American International Pictures and starring Vincent Price, were The Comedy of Terrors (1963) and War-Gods of the Deep (1965).After his final days working for film, Tourneur began directing television episodes. Tourneur filmed episodes of The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Bonanza, The Twilight Zone, and The Alaskans. Tourneur's final director credit was for an episode of T.H.E. Cat in 1966. Tourneur then retired and returned to France.\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nFeature films\n\nShort films\n\nTV\n1955-1961 : General Electric Theater, 4 episodes\n1955 : The Martyr\n1955 : Into the Night\n1960 : Aftermath\n1961 : Star Witness: The Lili Parrish Story\n1956 : Fireside Theater, 3 episodes\n1956 : A Hero Returns\n1956 : Kirsti\n1956 : The Mirror\n1957 : Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, 1 episode\n1957 : Outlaw's Boots\n1957 : The Walter Winchell File, 3 episodes\n1957 : The Steep Hill\n1958 : House on Biscayne Bay\n1958 : The Stopover\n1958 : Cool and Lam, CBS Productions\n1958 : Northwest Passage, 8 episodes\n1958 : The Gunsmith\n1958 : The Burning Village\n1958 : The Bond Women\n1959 : The Break Out\n1959 : The Vulture\n1959 : The Traitor\n1959 : The Assassin\n1959 : The Hostage\n1959 : Bonanza, 1 episode\n1960 : Denver McKee\n1959 : The Alaskans, 1 episode\n1960 : The Devil Makers\n1960 : The Barbara Stanwyck Show, 11 episodes\n1960 : The Mink Coat\n1960 : Ironbark's Bridge\n1960 : The Miraculous Journey of Tadpole Chan\n1961 : Frightened Doll\n1961 : The Choice\n1961 : Sign of the Zodiac\n1961 : Adventure on Happiness Street\n1961 : The Golden Acres\n1961 : Confession\n1961 : Dragon by the Tail\n1961 : Dear Charlie\n1962 : Adventures in Paradise, 1 episode\n1962 : A Bride for the Captain\n1962 : Follow the Sun, 1 episode\nSergeant Kolchak Fades Away\n1963 : The Twilight Zone, 1 episode\n1963 : Night Call\n1966 : T.H.E.

Quoted by Serge Le Péron in (Jacques Tourneur Le Médium), film by Alain Mazars, 2015. \nBy naming the main character Jessica Holland in his film Memoria (2021),  Apichatpong Weerasethakul pays tribute to Jacques Tourneur’s film I Walked with a Zombie.\nPassage 5:\nJean Rollin\nJean Michel Rollin Roth Le Gentil (French: [ʒɑ̃ mˈɪt‍ʃə‍l ɹˈə‍ʊlɪn lˈə d‍ʒˈɛnt]; 3 November 1938 – 15 December 2010) was a French film director, actor, and novelist best known for his work in the fantastique genre.\nRollin's career, spanning over fifty years, featured early short films and his achievements with his first four vampire classics Le viol du vampire (1968), La vampire nue (1970), Le frisson des vampires (1970), and Requiem pour un vampire (1971). Rollin's subsequent notable works include La rose de fer (1973), Lèvres de sang (1975), Les raisins de la mort (1978), Fascination (1979), and La morte vivante (1982).His films are noted for their exquisite, if mostly static, cinematography, off-kilter plot progression, poetic dialogue, playful surrealism and recurrent use of well-constructed female lead characters. Outlandish dénouements and abstruse visual symbols were trademarks. Belied by high production values and precise craftsmanship, his films were made with little money, often against deadlines. In the mid-1970s, lack of regular work led the director to direct mostly pornographic films under various pseudonyms, an activity he continued until the early 1980s.\n\nEarly life\nJean Rollin was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine (now Hauts-de-Seine), France, to Claude Louis René Rollin-Roth-Le Gentil, an actor and theatre director who went by the stage name Claude Martin, and his wife Denise (née Leffroi), an artists' model. His half-brother was actor Olivier Rollin.\n\nCareer\nRollin had a passion for cinema from an early age.  He saw his first film during the second World War. It was Capitaine Fracasse, a 1942 film directed by Abel Gance.  Rollin decided he wanted to make films when he grew up; his father, a theatre actor, was a heavy influence on him.  During his teens, he developed an obsession for American serials and read comic books.  \nWhen he was 16, he found a job at Les Films de Saturne, helping write invoices while earning some money though he wanted to be involved in cinema.  They specialized in creating opening and closing credits and short cartoons, but real films were also shot such as industrial shorts and documentaries.  Rollin was part of the crew in a short documentary about Snecma, a big factory in France which built motors and planes.  He arranged the tracking shots, laid the tracks, checked the electricity, and helped the cameraman.\nWhen Rollin did his military service for the French army, he worked as an editor in the cinema department alongside Claude Lelouch.  They worked on army commercials with Lelouch directing and Rollin editing. They also made two films, Mechanographie, a documentary, and La Guerre de Silence (The War of Silence), a real film with actors and a story.\nIn 1958 after leaving the army, he directed his first short film Les Amours Jaunes (The Yellow Lovers).  He shot it on a 35mm Maurigraphe camera, and used a beach in Dieppe as his location, the same beach used in his later films.\n\n1960s\nIn 1960, Rollin decided to direct his first feature film, but later abandoned the project as he had no money to finish it.  His next short, Ciel de Cuivre (Sky of Copper), was directed in 1961, and was quite surreal though it told a sentimental story.  He did not finish the film because he ran out of money and it was not very good.  The footage is now lost.\nIn 1962, he was as an assistant director on the film Un Cheval pour Deux (A Horse for Two), which was not a great experience for him, and he decided to approach cinema in a different way.  In the early sixties, Rollin became interested in politics and made a short documentary in 1964 called Vivre en Espagne (Life in Spain). It was about Generalissimo Francisco Franco, thirty minutes were filmed but he risked a lot to get it made.  Rollin and the crew found themselves pursued by the police and just managed to make it back into France.  Jean also directed a short film in 1965 called Les Pays Loins.\n\nIn 1968, Jean directed his first feature Le Viol du Vampire (The Rape of the Vampire).  At the time he was still not known in the world of cinema, having only done a few short films and documentaries.  The film was shot on a low budget, and consisted of two parts because it was originally intended to be another short film; the second part was later added so that it was released as a feature film.  The release of Le Viol caused public scandal and outrage, his strong inspiration of American serials did not attract viewers.  It was released during the events of May 1968, and due to the riots, it was a rare theatrical production at the time. Rollin himself was also threatened due to this scandal, because of this, he briefly decided to give up making films.\nHis second feature La Vampire Nue (The Nude Vampire) was his first film in colour.  It was mostly inspired by the 1916 film Judex, and also surrealism in general. Rollin wanted to do something a little more temperate than Le Viol, a traditional mystery film. Anyway, as he himself stated, it came to be the same kind of film as his first feature, it also has the same spirit. La vampire nue also became notable in that it introduced Catherine and Marie-Pierre Castel, twin sisters who frequently collaborated with Rollin during the early years of his career.\nFollowing La vampire nue, Rollin found himself in a financial crisis and having suffered an accident during production which left him traumatized, the circumstances took a positive turn when he met with producer Monique Nathan, owner of the Films Moderns company. Nathan having put her faith and support in Rollin, turned down several a number of the most prominent French New Wave filmmakers for financing and instead entirely supported Rollin as both a producer and a co-screenwriter for his next project, Le Frisson des Vampires (Shiver of the Vampires) which was heavily influenced by the trappings of the hippie movement. It did however retain many of the themes one could expect from a Rollin film and one of the most iconic scenes ever to appear in a Rollin film: actress Dominique emerging from an old grandfather clock. Production for the film took place in an abandoned castle in Soissons, a commune in the Aisne department of Picardy.\n\n1970s\n1971, Rollin directed Requiem pour un Vampire (Requiem for a Vampire), which became one of his most successful films, and it was another low budget production, which almost took no money to produce.  There was no dialogue in the first forty minutes of the film, this was in Rollin's words to make the \"ultimate naive film\", simplifying the story, direction and cinematography. Initially, Rollin had Catherine Castel in mind to play one of the leading ladies in Requiem; however, Castel was unable to accept the role due to being pregnant, which forced Rolling to offer the role to Maire-Pierre. The second female lead was portrayed by Mireille D'argent whom Rollin chose after she was introduced to him by an agent. Rollin discovered that D'argent's agent was collecting her wages, which prompted him to contact a lawyer and have her wages returned to her. Requiem was filmed in the small village of Crêvecoeur. The graveyard was located outside the village on a knoll. The castle, a historical place entirely furnished with genuine antiques, all of which were worth a fortune, had been rented from the duchess of Roche-Guyon. It wasn't her castle that Rollin and the crew were interested in, but the ruins of the dungeon above, that overlooked the entire area. Following this, Rollin made a temporary departure to creating films associated with the erotic vampire genre.\nHaving risen to success during his early vampire era, Rollin embarked on a different approach to filmmaking. Rollin financed his 1973 film La Rose de Fer (The Iron Rose) himself and was convinced that it would become a failure, leading to financial ruin. Prior to production, he engaged in a deal with Impex films to direct a number of hardcore porn films in the near future in order to produce La rose de fer and ensure that it would not fail. The story follows two young lovers (Françoise Pascal and Hugues Quester) who meet at a wedding reception and agree to go on a date, for which they decide to take a walk in an enormous cemetery. As they make love in an underground tomb, strange and bizarre occurrences take place above ground. As night falls, they frantically try to escape from the cemetery, and with no luck, end up where they started. They are slowly overcome with hysteria and paranoia which brings about their mortality. The film was shot in the city of Amiens over a four-week period and premiered at the 2nd Annual Convention of the Fantastique in Paris in April 1973 and was initially met with a negative reception and as a result, Rollin was unable to find anyone to back his future personal projects.Rollin directed the adult sex films Jeunes filles impudiques (Schoolgirl Hitchhikers), Le sourire vertical (The Vertical Smile), and Tout le monde il en a deux (Bacchanales sexuelles or Fly Me the French Way) under the pseudonym Michel Gentil as he was financially unable to come up with a budget for another mainstream feature film. However, in 1974 Rollin directed the horror adventure and self-proclaimed \"Expressionist\" film Les démoniaques which was inspired by the adventure classics he had enormous admiration for in his youth. The film includes Joëlle Cœur and Willy Braque whom Rollin worked with on Jeunes filles impudiques. The story follows two young women who have been involved in a shipwreck and are brutally raped and murdered by a group of rogue pirates, only to be resurrected after making love to the devil so that they can seek their revenge. Rollin had many disputes with the producers of the film during production of the project as they insisted on a low budget. He was hospitalized for two weeks following the work due to mental and physical exhaustion. Further problems would arise including the working title, Les diablesses, having to be changed as the copyright was not free of charge and with the Castel Twins being unavailable for the roles of the avenging ghosts, the parts where offered to inexperienced actresses Lieva Lone and Patricia Hermenier.Rollin made a brief return to the erotic vampire genre in 1975 when he wrote and directed Lèvres de sang (Lips of Blood). The film includes all the surreal dreamlike aspects for which Rollin's films are known. The story follows a young man named Frederic who is on a quest to find a woman dressed in white following the discovery of a photo of a ruined château. The photo triggers a suppressed childhood memory, which may be a dream. Despite his mother trying to convince him that it was dream, Frederic becomes fixated and obsessed with location the castle and the woman that may be inside. Lèvres de sang features Jean-Loup Philippe, whom Rollin co-wrote the film with, Annie Belle, and Nathalie Perrey, whom Rollin had worked with frequently throughout his career as a credited actress, script writer and editor. The film also sees the return of the Castel Twins as part of a group of vampires.\nDue to the commercial failures of both La rose de fer and Lèvres de sang, Rollin again had no choice but to direct another adult sex film for financial reasons as there was no possible way to produce a feature film for the foreseeable future. Phantasmes (Once Upon a Virgin) was written and directed by Rollin for release in 1975 and was the first and only pornographic film in which he was credited under his own name because he liked what he did in the film. Rollin mentioned that the film is his \"first and final attempt at a serious\" adult film, wanting to create a film that didn't just \"poke fun at sex\". The score for Phantasmes is considered one of the films best attributes, courtesy of composer Didier William Lepauw of Lèvres de sang.Between 1976 and 1977, his work consisted strictly of hardcore pornographic films as there was a lack of money and producers reluctant to fund any new mainstream projects due to his previous commercial failures. Seven porn films were produced within this period under his pseudonym Michel Gentil, and one of which, Suce moi vampire (Suck Me Vampire: the hardcore version of Lèvres de sang), he credited himself as Michel Gand. His 1976 hardcore film Douces pénétraitions marked the final time the Castel Twins would appear together working for Rollin, and the final time Marie-Pierre would work with him altogether. Catherine would continue to appear in his films for several years.\nJean Rollin returned in 1978, when he wrote and directed Les raisins de la mort (The Grapes of Death) which has been considered the first French gore film. It has been described as one of the most pivotal films in his entire canon and is seen as a rare departure from his usual dreamlike and poetic works. Following the negative reception and commercial failures of his previous films and having to direct pornographic pictures, Rollin eventually gained financial backing to produce his next mainstream feature. The story here features a young woman, Elisabeth (Marie-Georges Pascal) who is travelling to a secluded vineyard in the mountains owned by her fiancé. There she discovers that the local residents who occupy the village have been transformed into mindless zombies by a dangerous pesticide which contaminated the grapes growing at the vineyard following a wine festival which occurred some days before.\nThe film includes pornographic actress Brigitte Lahaie, in her first mainstream role, as Rollin was the first French director to recognise her acting capabilities and offer her much more prominent roles in his subsequent films. Rollin stated that Les raisins de la mort was his \"first traditional, almost conventional, production\" which was because the film acquired solid finances with made a change and with special effects supplied by Italian experts. Claude Becognee served as director of photography which added to the film's success. Rollin would credit much of the film's success to Marie-Georges Pascal's portrayal of Elisabeth, whom he would recall delivered a very \"moving\" performance in the film. Les raisins de la mort was shot in the deserted mountain region of Les Cévennes.\nThe film is often referred to as being influenced by George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. However, it has more in common with Jorge Grau's 1974 Spanish-Italian horror film Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (also known as The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue). The film does not follow the tradition zombie method, instead, Rollin's zombies centre on madness with a strong environmentally conscious message. As he has mentioned, the zombies \"have retained their consciousness\" and they finally \"suffer for what they are\". With the film as a notable success, Rollin would continue with pornographic films under a new pseudonym, Robert Xavier, while retaining the Michel Gentil credit.\nIn 1979, and now established as a somewhat successful director, Rollin created Fascination in which he returned to the roots of the fantastique genre his early works are known for. The film is inspired by the short story Un verre de sang (A Glass of Blood) from French poet Jean Lorrain with tells the tale of wealthy French people, who, at the turn of the century, begin to drink the blood of bulls in order to cure anemia. The title of the film refers to and pays homage to a French magazine of the same name which is dedicated to different forms of eroticism in art. Rollin's story of Fascination differs slightly from that of Lorrain's novel, in that, in the year 1905 a group of wealthy Parisian women arrive at an abattoir to drink the blood of an ox as it is believed to be a curative for anemia. The central story follows two lovers Elizabeth and Eva (Franca Maï and Brigitte Lahaie respectively), chambermaids-in-waiting who reside at a deserted castle and are suddenly interrupted by a thief named Mark (Jean-Pierre Lemaire), who takes refuge at the castle in order to hide from a group of thieves he has stolen coins from. When Mark makes love to Eva, she is forced to go outside and confront the thieves in the nearby stables to make a deal; she is forced to have sex with one of the male thieves and subsequently they are murdered by Eva in an iconic scene with Eva wielding a scythe. It is soon revealed that Elizabeth and Eva are expecting a group of women to arrive where sensual love making takes place and the women are revealed to devour the blood of humans.\nThe film is often said to be of the vampire genre. However, it does not feature the elements which his early vampire films are known for, aside from the drinking of blood. The production of Fascination was not without complications; as it may have been one of the easiest films to shot in Rollin's experience, despite the low budget, the story was met with disapproval from the film's producer, Christine Renaud. As Rollin himself had said, the \"co-producer wanted (him) to make a very explicit sex film-straight exploitation fare without too much emphasis on the fantastical elements\". Rollin overcame these obstacles and made the film he wanted. Additional members of the crew included Nathalie Perrey, who designed the costumes, and Philippe D'Aram, who provided the score. It was predicted that Fascination would lead to success, as did Les raisins de la mort. However, in a setback, one of the directors of UGC, a huge French distributor, cancelled the screenings Rollin had been promised. As the film was yet another financial failure for Rollin, he had little choice but to resume his pornographic works with continued until the end of the 1970s.\n\n1980s\nAs Jean Rollin's career continued into the 1980s, he started off the decade with the release of La nuit des traquées (The Night of the Hunted) in the summer of 1980. This mainstream feature saw the return of pornographic actress Brigitte Lahaie, in her first leading role in a Rollin film. Upon the film's debut, it was considered a failure. However, it eventually garnered somewhat of a following in later years, as several of Rollin's works have done in the past. La nuit des traquées was shot in less than ten days on an extremely low budget, similar to his pornographic films. Rollin admitted that \"I was tired of X-films\", as the film was intended to be another hardcore sex film and told the producer \"if you want a horror film for the same cost\", then, \"I can make it in 9 days\". Rollin came to the decision to cast actors of the pornographic industry in the picture in order to keep production cost down and to give the actors the opportunity to show their legitimate talent. The film stands as a noteworthy piece of work in Rollin's canon, as it differs from any of his previous work and is a departure from the fantastique genre that his films are greatly known for; the film is often poetic, yet it serves a realistic tone and chilling atmosphere. Lahaie portrays the character of Elizabeth, a young woman discovered wandering around in the rain on a dark night, by a man named Robert (Vincent Gardère). As Elizabeth has no recollection of why she is there and frequently continues to lose her memory every few minutes, Robert drives her to his apartment in the city where they make love. The following morning while Robert goes to work, a doctor named Francis and a woman named Solange (Bernard Papineau and Rachel Mhas) locate Elizabeth and accompany her back to the clinic where she has escaped from. It is revealed that Elizabeth and fellow patients are currently confined to the hospital for a deteriorating disease in which they have been contaminated by an environmental accident.\nIn addition to Lahaie, Rollin had actress Martine Delva in mind for the role of Lahaie's character's friend Véronique. Delva was introduced to Rollin and Lionel Wallman by actor Alain Plumey and when offered the role, she accepted the role. Prior to production, which was intended to take place in La Défense district, she was involved in a serious car accident which left her unconscious with a broken leg and she died within one week from her injuries. The role of Véronique then offered to Dominique Journet. Pornographic actress Catherine Greiner and frequent collaborator, Natalie Perrey appeared as patients at the hospital.\nIn the early year of the film, it was met with a negative reception and did not please audiences during its release; not receiving a successful response at the Stigès Festival,. It did however receive positive reaction when it was screened at a festival in Trieste, where it was applauded and viewed as a highly subversive work. Rollin himself had stated that \"I don't think it is a very good film and it is probably one of my worst\" and that if he could remake just one of his films it would be La nuit des traquées.In 1980, Rollin directed the Spanish zombie horror feature, Le lac des morts vivants (commonly known as Zombie Lake) under the pseudonym J.A. Lazer. Jésus Franco was intended to direct the film, and with an unfortunate turn of events he became unavailable. At this point, Rollin was planning to take a vacation, and on the morning he was expecting to leave, he received a phone call from the production company Eurociné asking if he would be interested directing the horror film which was due to start filming the next morning, as Franco could not be located. Rollin agreed, and arrived on set the following morning. The company could not attach Rollin's name to the project due to issues with the contact, as a Spanish name had to be credited for the film and J.A. Lazer was chosen. Le lac des morts vivants was released in 1981 and Rollin admitted that he never really cared for the film. It contains most of the elements which one would expect from a Franco film, and includes Franco's frequent collaborators such as actors Howard Vernon, Nadine Pascal, Antonio Mayans and Alain Petit, and composer Daniel White. Photography for the film was courtesy of Max Monteillet, who Rollin would later work with in several projects. Rollin himself made a cameo appearance in the film.In 1981, Rollin returned with the drama film, Les paumées du petit matin (The Escapees or The Runaways). It marks a departure to the usual horror tones which his films are notable for, and here mixes drama with elements of adventure, thriller and crime, while maintaining erotic and poetic themes and remains a distinctive and unique piece of work from Rollin. The story follows two young women who are confined to mental asylum in the countryside; Michelle (Laurence Dubas), a troubled teenager, has been returned to the asylum after escaping and is forced into a straitjacket. She manages to get the attention of Marie (Christiane Coppé), a teenage girl who is who sits in the garden on a rocking chair, while staring into space and never speaks, by dropping a tin food dish from her bedroom window and the sound somehow brings Marie back to reality. They escape from the asylum and encounter a group of burlesque dancers, a bar singer and a group of women who proceed to rape Marie. Their journey ends when they become involved in crime and death. The cast includes Rollin's usual collaborators Louise Dhour, Nathalie Perrey, Brigitte Lahie and a cameo appearance from Rollin himself. Les paumées du petit matin unfortunately failed to receive a proper theatrical in 1981 which resulted in it being one of the most difficult Rollin films to find in future. It did however receive its first DVD release in 2009 in the United States courtesy of Redemption Films, with a subsequent release in the United Kingdom. Again with a limited budget an issues with the script, Rollin stated that there were many problems with the production right from the beginning; that it was \"an incredible mess\", filled with \"clichés and platitudes of melodrama.\" Later reviews of the film have been quite positive; Cathal Tohill and Pete Tombs would go so far as to call it a schizophrenic work in their wonderful Immoral Tales, but they would also note that \"the beginning and end are pure Rollin\" and \"what is good in (The Escapees) is very good.\"\nHis 1982 film, La morte vivante (The Living Dead Girl) was his most commercial and successful work since Les raisins de la mort. In addition to its small budget, Rollin again had to contend with producers to construct a film that he wanted, as they required another zombie piece. He was reluctant to do so and was influenced to create a film with combinations from his previous works. Rollin described that the living dead girl is sort of a vampire woman who devours the blood of humans, taking the idea from his vampire works, but not exactly making her a vampire. The gore is a notable aspect taken from Les raisins de la mort. His usual poetic, supernatural and horror themes are still present within the film. Rollin created the story of a young woman named Catherine Valmont (Françoise Blanchard) who has been dead and buried in her family vault beneath the Valmont mansion for the past two years. As three thieves enter the vaults and plan to rob Catherine and her deceased relative of their jewellery as they lay in their coffins, an earth tremor occurs, which suddenly resurrects Catherine. Unaware of her surroundings, she must acquire human victims and drink their blood to prevent her descending into madness and possibly death, with drifting in and out of childhood memories of her childhood friend, Hélène (Marina Pierro). During which, a photographer, Barbara (Carina Barone), becomes fascinated by Catherine when she discovers her and thinks she is quite peculiar, and sets out to uncover a mystery. Catherine's childhood friend, Hélène is intending to buy the Valmont mansion, which is currently on the market and a strange phone call leads her to the home where she discovers that Catherine is alive and the bodies of the thieves and the real estate agent and her boyfriend. Trying to convince herself that Catherine did not actually die, she realises that she has returned from the dead and must help her by bringing her unsuspecting victims. Some of the financing for the film was courtesy of Jacques Raif, who co-wrote the feature. The film's photographer Pierre LeBlond, found a castle which would become the Valmont mansion, which they rented. The castle provided accommodation for the cast and crew, in which the owner offered to cook. According to Rollin, the owner insisted on being referred to as \"His Lordship\" and that he was very difficult to get along with  Actress, Françoise Blanchard was introduced to Rollin by Fanny Magier, a co-star actress who appeared in the film. When Blanchard arrived, Rollin was unsure whether to offer her the role of Catherine due to the fact that in the first scene in which her character is resurrected, Blanchard appeared wearing trousers which wasn't required for the scene and Rollin did not ask her to remove them. She did however receive the role due to good contact. Blanchard showed great professionalism in her role and in one particular scene, the final scene of the film, in which Blanchard's character cries and screams after devouring her childhood friend, the crew became concerned over her mental state as they thought she has descended into madness. She gave an amazing performance for the role. During the preparation of the film, Rollin had been to Rome with Lionel Wallman to find an actress to portray the role of Hélène. Rollin had Teresa Ann Savoy in mind for the role, whom he was greatly impressed with. After speaking with Savoy and showing her a script for a pornographic picture which was in English and devoid of interest and not for La morte vivante, as she didn't speak French, she refused the role and told her agent that she would never in her life shoot with a guy like him. His second choice was actress Marina Pierro, a recurring collaborator with director Walerian Borowczyk, whom Rollin instantly liked. Pierro accepted the role. In the role of the photographers, American actor Mike Marshall, whom Rollin enjoyed working with during the production received the role of Greg and Canadian actress Carina Barone, was offered the role of Barbara due to a previous actress who featured in Les paumées du petit matin turning it down as she unmistakable believed that it was supposedly an erotic film. The film was a commercial success within theatres and received quite a positive reception, especially in Italy. Upon its release, Rollin was betrayed by a dishonest distributor who premiered in a select number of small theatres behind his back, as the film deserved a much larger audience in highly established theatres. However, La morte vivante was selected in many festivals which gave the film little success, particularly in Rome where Rollin's friend, Andriano Pintaldi presented the film in his festival where it was given the public's award.After directing three additional pornographic features following La morte Vivante, Rollin's next feature film, Les trottoirs de Bangkok (The Sidewalks of Bangkok) was released in 1984. It is a rare production for Rollin, in that it does not contain his traditional fare of the supernatural, horror, or the fantastique genre. It is highly influenced by Rollin's childhood passion for old serials as it contains themes of adventure, crime and mystery, comic-book fantasy and is inspired by the 1932 Boris Karloff classic The Mask of Fu Manchu. The leading protagonist of the film is pornographic actress, Yoko, whom Rollin mentioned that he had \"never worked with an actor who was so open-minded and easy to direct.\" She portrays the role of Eva, who is on the run from the French Secret Service and a rival syndicate who desperate require a deadly chemical which she possesses. This is her only mainstream role outside of the pornographic industry. Françoise Blanchard returns in her second film with Rollin, as she appears in the role of Claudine, a woman who works for the syndicate and is forced to locate Eva and hand her over to her villainous boss, instead she chooses to protect Eva. Supporting cast includes Argentina actor Gérard Landry, Israeli actress Brigitte Borghese, Jean-Pierre Bouyxou, whom Rollin has worked with on numerous occasions throughout his career, and a cameo appearance from Rollin. On a limited budget, and again working with producer Lionel Wallman and cinematographer Claude Becognee, the production of Les trottoris de Bangkok was filmed in several locations, many of which were not given permission to; the Chinese Quarter of Porte d'Italie and on the docks where goods from Asia were unloaded, an abandoned den near the Champs-Élysées, and on part of the French railroad. The film became a success and Rollin admitted that despite the fact that the film was a mess, he said \"the entire shoot was great fun.\" Working with Yoko prompted Rollin to write a new film which included her alongside Brigitte Lahaie which unfortunately never became a film as Yoko retired from acting in the early nineties.Rollin received minor work following Les trottoirs de Bangkok; in 1985, he resumed his pseudonymous work as \"Michel Gentil\" with a non-pornographic feature, the slapstick comedy, Ne prends pas les poulets pour des pigeons which reunited Brigitte Borghese and Gérard Landry from his previous film, and included French actor and comedian Popeck. Rollin was hired, and therefore his real name was not attached to the project. In 1988, he received the uncredited directorial role in the erotic sequel Emmanuelle 6, for which he wrote the screenplay. The film suffered many flaws during production under direction from Bruno Zincone and Rollin became involved in an attempt to salvage what he could and see that production was completed for the financiers.At the end of the decade, Rollin created Perdues dans New York (Lost in New York) which was produced in 1989. Rollin mentioned that the film was \"an anthology of all the themes and obsessive images I have used in my films\", and that it, \"brought to an end what had been started within the previous 13 films.\" A friend of Rollin's who was a producer insisted his help as he need location shots of New York an upcoming TV series he was working on. Rollin agreed and travelled to New York with a small film crew and a 16mm camera. While filming the shots, Rollin was struck with an idea to improvise a theme in which two young women are separated and desperately search for one another. He produced the film with a runtime of just under one hour and immediately struggled to find distribution, whether it be released to theatres or television. It was difficult to find distribution for independent and exploitation pictures in the late eighties as in a time of revolution and change, distributors would only pick up more commercial and high-budget film. It was not until the following years that the film found its audience on the home video market. Initially, Perdues dans New York was to be the final production of Rollin's canon as he has become ill during this period, and he expressed gratitude to his many fan by paying homage to his early works.\nDespite his intentions to retire from directing following Perdues dans New York, his final film of the 1980s, Killing Car (working title Femme dangereuse) was produced in 1989. It is a revenge thriller and one of his most underrated and overlooked works. Initially intended to be a softcore production under the Michel Gentil pseudonym, Rollin attached his own name to the project and made it one of his most personal and self-referential of all his works. The film was shot on 16mm and in less than a week on a minimal budget of under $100,000. Australian model Tiki Tsang, originally of Brisbane, Queensland, had been residing in Paris, France for sometime when she was discovered by Rollin and offered her the role of \"The Car Woman\", a strange woman who steals an old Buick and proceeds to kill a number of people to seek revenge for a past tragedy. The part of \"The Car Woman\" was written especially for Tsang in what is the only film credit to her name. Killing Car gives nod to previous Rollin works including Tsang emerging from a grandfather clock (as did Dominique in an iconic scene from Les frisson des vampires). Max Monteillet returned as cinematographer and Philippe Brejean provided the score. Cast includes recurring collaborators Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and Jean-Loup Philippe. Following the production, Rollin was hospitalized due to exhaustion and started editing the film after his recovery. The editing process lasted two years. Several problems would arise during post-production, as the film found it difficult to receive distribution, like Perdues dans New York, if it could not receive a theatrical distribution, Rollin would settle for a video or television release. The film was eventually released in 1993. It was announced that no usable print or negative of the film exists today, and all known film negatives are considered lost.\n\n1990s\nRollin's final adult production came in 1994 when he made a brief return to direct (uncredited) and wrote the scenario for Le Parfume de Mathilde (The Scent of Mathilde). Rollin was initially required as a screenwriter for the production due to the fact that he was to replace producer Marc Dorcel's in-house auteur Michele Ricaud, who has just recently passed away. However, Rollin became co-director of the made-for-video film. Following his final time working on a sex film, Rollin later returned to his traditional works when he would go on to resume what he was best known for.Rollin continued his career into the 1990s, following what was intended to be a brief return in 1994 when he directed and wrote a final pornographic film. He remained true to form for what were to be his final years of film making, and his next feature went into production in 1995; Les deux orphelines vampires (The Two Orphan Vampires) saw the return of his most recognizable work, and his first vampire film since 1975's Levres de sang. With the then recent increase in popularity of Rollin's works, and with the resurgence with the vampire genre in general, most notable with Bram Stoker's Dracula, this prompted Rollin to create a new vampire feature, quite different from Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 blockbuster, as he stated that it was \"not a good film at all\", and that \"it just doesn't work for one second\". The idea of the film was based upon Rollin's novel of the same name and went into production in June 1995 for a mere ₣3,000,000, which is actually more than his prior works received. Locations for the shoot included four days in New York at the beginning, with the remaining three weeks in Paris. Cinematography was provided by Norbert Marfaing-Sintes, who previously worked with Italian director Duccio Tessari, as Max Monteillet was not available. Nathalie Perrey introduced Rollin to Marfaing-Sintes, as she had experience working with Marfaing-Sintes in many films; to show his gratitude, Rollin offered Perrey a role in Les deux orphelines vampires. The leading roles were offered to two inexperienced actresses, Alexandra Pic and Isabelle Teboul, whom Rollin choose while answering a newspaper ad they had printed. Brigitte Lahaie received a minor role in the film. Following an extensive period in post-production, the film was eventually released on 9 July 1997.\nHis next directorial feature, La fiancée de Dracula (The Fiancée of Dracula) went into production in 1999. Rollin had written the screenplay for the film, as he did with many of his previous works. During which time, Rollin was receiving dialysis for kidney disease and for periods of time, did not remain with the film crew and production was shared with Jean-Noël Delamarre in his absence, while Rolling was staying at a hotel in Caen. Filming locations included the islands of Chausey where the majority of the filming took place, a cemetery in Épinay-Champlâtreux, a castle in Blandy, Seine-et-Marne, and port of Pourville-lès-Dieppes. Long-time collaborators Brigitte Lahaie, Catherine Castel and Nathalie Perrey returned for prominent roles in the film. Rollin's niece, Sandrine Thoquet appeared in the film as a young vampire burned by the rays of the sun. Following production, Rollin received a kidney transplant in October 2000 during the post-production which lasted for almost two years. The film was successfully shown in theatres on 14 August 2002, for which Rollin was not completely satisfied of the release date. However, he was pleased that it was released to theaters and was somewhat well received.\n\nPersonal life and death\nRollin was married to Simone Rollin Roth Le Gentil (née Morel), with whom he had two sons, Serge and Carel. He was married to Simone until his death.\nRollin died on 15 December 2010 after a long battle with cancer and was survived by his wife Simone, son Serge and granddaughter Gabrielle. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Rollin's son, Carel (1973–2001), and his wife, Simone (1934–2016), rest alongside him.\n\nSelected filmography\nThe following list consists of Jean Rollin's mainstream works as both director and writer and not of his pseudonym or pornographic works.

Her most notable work is that of her role in the 1982 French film La morte vivante, directed by Jean Rollin. Blanchard had collaborated with Rollin on several occasions in films Les trottoirs de Bangkok (1984), À la poursuite de Barbara (1991) and La nuit des horloges (2007). She had worked frequently with directors Richard Balducci and Jesús Franco. She was also known for her work as a voice artist, having dubbed films, such as, Robert Altman's Popeye (1980), The NeverEnding Story III (1994) and Hackers (1995), and animated television series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Totally Spies!\n\nCareer\nBlanchard's career stretched from between the late 1970s until the early 1990s. She may have been best known for playing Catherine Valmont in 1982 horror La Morte Vivante (The Living Dead Girl), a film from Jean Rollin.\nShe also appeared in films by directors Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei. She recalled her career in an interview, which was featured on the Encore release of La Morte Vivante, she mentioned that it was a tragedy and a coincidence that started her career in the late 1970s. While trying to make ends meet as a hand model, she lost her brother in the late 1970. Around that same time she was offered her first role, coincidentally as someone who had also lost a family member. Françoise approached the part skeptically as she remembered that at that time she was, \"aggressive against people but also a bit confused\" due to the death of her brother. She enjoyed the experience and took a serious interest in acting, so decided to take acting lessons afterwards.Blanchard soon became involved in several B movies when her career quickly became intertwined with the legendary Eurocine company. \"I liked the feel of these B movies, especially horror\", Françoise noted to Encore, which perhaps explains why she became so popular to several of the most noteworthy genre directors of the late 1970s. She also mentioned that she didn't mind nudity and even went so far as to pose for Lui Magazine in the early 1980s. After several films directors such as Pierre Chevalier, Françoise took a role in Bruno Mattei's Caligula and Messalina in 1981. The following year she appeared in Jess Franco's Revenge In The House Of Usher, and she liked Franco and admired his creativity and fire.She then appeared in the La Morte Vivante with Rollin. The night shoot on the film was mostly difficult and there were many problems with the special effects but, despite some disagreements, she liked and admired Rollin and admitted to Encore that, \"he is really nice and is very much there\". She enjoyed working with and admired her co-star in the film, Italian actress Marina Pierro, and noted, \"she is very maternal with me.\" Françoise worked again with Rollin in Les Trottoirs De Bangkok (The Sidewalks Of Bangkok), a film which she had a lot of fun making, and she appeared in his newest film production La nuit des horloges (The Night of Clocks) opposite Ovidie.\n\nDeath\nBlanchard died on 24 May 2013, twelve days before her 59th birthday. The cause of death was not disclosed.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 7:\nGiulio Questi\nGiulio Questi (18 March 1924 – 3 December 2014) was an Italian film director and screenwriter.Questi was born in Bergamo.  He wrote short stories and filmed several documentaries before he started as assistant director and script writer in the movie business.\nHe is best known for the films La morte ha fatto l'uovo and Django Kill! (If You Live Shoot!).\nQuesti died in Rome, aged 90.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 8:\nMr. Right (2009 film)\nMr. Right is a 2009 British film directed by David Morris and Jacqui Morris.

{"input": "What is the date of death of Duleep Singh's father?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThomas Scott (diver)\nThomas Scott (1907 - date of death unknown) was an English diver.\n\nBoxing\nHe competed in the 10 metre platform at the 1930 British Empire Games for England.\n\nPersonal life\nHe was a police officer at the time of the 1930 Games.\nPassage 2:\nVictor Duleep Singh\nPrince Victor Albert Jay Duleep Singh (10 July 1866 – 7 June 1918) was the eldest son of Maharani Bamba Müller and Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of Lahore, and of the Sikh Empire, and the grandson of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\n\nBiography\nVictor Duleep Singh was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he met Lady Anne Blanche Alice Coventry whom he would later marry. In 1887 he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, with a special Cadetship and left it the following December to be commissioned as Lieutenant into the 1st (Royal) Dragoons. \n\nIn 1889 Singh was stationed at Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a member of the staff of General Sir John Ross, commander of British forces in British North America. In December, he was rumoured to be engaged to marry Jeanne Turnure, daughter of Lawrence Turnure, a New York City banker, after staying at the Turnure house in Newport, Rhode Island, the previous summer; the rumour was however denied by the banker. In February the following year, Singh took a three-month leave of absence from the army to meet his father in Paris, when rumours of unpaid creditors in Halifax became current for the first time. He continued to serve in the Royal Dragoons until he resigned his commission in 1898.On the death of his father, Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh, on 23 October 1893, Victor succeeded him as Head of the Royal House of the Punjab.On 4 January 1898, Prince Victor Albert Jay Duleep Singh married Lady Anne Coventry, a daughter of the 9th Earl of Coventry, who was eight years younger than himself. The marriage created a sensation: it was the first time an Indian prince had married an English noblewoman, and the marriage was made possible primarily due to the intervention of the Prince of Wales (subsequently King Edward VII). The wedding took place at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, London, where Queen Victoria was also represented. Although Queen Victoria gave the couple her blessing, she allegedly told Lady Anne to never have children with the Prince. The marriage remained childless.Singh was declared bankrupt on 4 September 1902, with debts totaling £117,900 (approximately £12.8 million in today's value), despite his £8,250 annual allowance and his wife's income of £2,500. The bankruptcy was attributed to bad investments and to gambling, something that plagued him for the rest of his life.He died, without legitimate issue, aged 51, on 7 June 1918, and was buried at the Anglican Cemetery above Monte Carlo. Beside him is the grave of his wife who died aged 82, on 2 July 1956.\n\nHonours\nNational dynastic honours\nHouse of Punjab: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Propitious Star of Punjab\n House of Punjab: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Ranjit Singh\n\nNational honours\nUnited Kingdom: Recipient of the King Edward VII Coronation Medal\n United Kingdom: Recipient of the King George V Coronation Medal\n\nAncestry\nPassage 3:\nFrederick Duleep Singh\nPrince Frederick Victor Duleep Singh, MVO, TD, FSA (23 January 1868 – 15 August 1926), also known as Prince Freddy, was a younger son of Sir Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire.\n\nEarly life\nPrince Frederick was born in London as the third son (the second surviving after the oldest son died on the first day after his birth) of Sir Duleep Singh and Bamba Müller, the former Maharaja and Maharani Duleep of Lahore. \nHe was educated at Eton and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he read History (B.A. 1890; M.A. 1894).

He survived smallpox in infancy but lost sight in his left eye. He fought his first battle alongside his father at age 10. After his father died, he fought several wars to expel the Afghans in his teenage years and was proclaimed as the \"Maharaja of Punjab\" at age 21. His empire grew in the Punjab region under his leadership through 1839.Prior to his rise, the Punjab region had numerous warring misls (confederacies), twelve of which were under Sikh rulers and one Muslim. Ranjit Singh successfully absorbed and united the Sikh misls and took over other local kingdoms to create the Sikh Empire. He repeatedly defeated invasions by outside armies, particularly those arriving from Afghanistan, and established friendly relations with the British.Ranjit Singh's reign introduced reforms, modernisation, investment into infrastructure and general prosperity. His Khalsa army and government included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. His legacy includes a period of Sikh cultural and artistic renaissance, including the rebuilding of the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar as well as other major gurudwaras, including Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Bihar and Hazur Sahib Nanded, Maharashtra under his sponsorship. Ranjit Singh was succeeded by his son Kharak Singh.\n\nEarly years\nRanjit Singh was born in a Jat Sikh family on 13 November 1780 to Maha Singh and Raj Kaur in Gujranwala, Punjab region (present-day Punjab, Pakistan). His mother Raj Kaur was the daughter of Jat Sikh Raja Gajpat Singh of Jind. Upon his birth, he was named Buddh Singh after his ancestor who was first in line to take Amrit Sanchaar. The child's name was changed to Ranjit (literally, \"victor in battle\") Singh (\"lion\") by his father to commemorate his army's victory over the Chattha chieftain Pir Muhammad.\n\nRanjit Singh contracted smallpox as an infant, which resulted in the loss of sight in his left eye and a pockmarked face. He was short in stature, never schooled, and did not learn to read or write anything beyond the Gurmukhi alphabet. However, he was trained at home in horse riding, musketry and other martial arts.At age 12, his father died. He then inherited his father's Sukerchakia Misl estates and was raised by his mother Raj Kaur, who, along with Lakhpat Rai, also managed the estates. The first attempt on his life was made when he was 13, by Hashmat Khan, but Ranjit Singh prevailed and killed the assailant instead. At age 18, his mother died and Lakhpat Rai was assassinated, and thereon he was helped by his mother-in-law from his first marriage.\n\nPersonal life\nWives\nIn 1789, Ranjit Singh married his first wife Mehtab Kaur, the muklawa happened in 1796. She was the only daughter of Gurbaksh Singh Kanhaiya and his wife Sada Kaur, and the granddaughter of Jai Singh Kanhaiya, the founder of the Kanhaiya Misl. This marriage was pre-arranged in an attempt to reconcile warring Sikh misls, wherein Mehtab Kaur was betrothed to Ranjit Singh in 1786. However, the marriage failed, with Mehtab Kaur never forgiving the fact that her father had been killed in battle with Ranjit Singh's father and she mainly lived with her mother after marriage. The separation became complete when Ranjit Singh married Datar Kaur of the Nakai Misl in 1797 and she turned into Ranjit's most beloved wife. Mehtab Kaur had three sons, Ishar Singh who was born in 1804 and twins Sher Singh and Tara Singh born in 1807. According to historian Jean-Marie Lafont, she was the only one to bear the title of Maharani. She died in 1813, after suffering from a failing health.\nHis second marriage was to, Datar Kaur (Born Raj Kaur) the youngest child and only daughter of Ran Singh Nakai, the third ruler of the Nakai Misl and his wife Karmo Kaur. They were betrothed in childhood by Datar Kaur's eldest brother, Sardar Bhagwan Singh, who briefly became the chief of the Nakai Misl, and Ranjit Singh's father Maha Singh. They were married in 1797; this marriage was a happy one. Ranjit Singh always treated Raj Kaur with love and respect. Since Raj Kaur was also the name of Ranjit Singh's mother, she was renamed Datar Kaur. In 1801, she gave birth to their son and heir apparent, Kharak Singh. Datar Kaur bore Ranjit Singh two other sons, Rattan Singh and Fateh Singh. Like his first marriage, the second marriage also brought him strategic military alliance. She was exceptionally intelligent and assisted him in affairs of the State. During the expedition to Multan in 1818, she was given command alongside her son, Kharak Singh. Throughout her life she remained Ranjit Singh's favorite  and for no other did he have greater respect for than Datar Kaur, who he affectionately called Mai Nakain.  Even though she was his second wife she became his principal wife and chief consort. During a hunting trip with Ranjit Singh, she fell ill and died on 20 June 1838.\nRatan Kaur and Daya Kaur were wives of Sahib Singh Bhangi of Gujrat (a misl north of Lahore, not to be confused the state of Gujarat). After Sahib Singh's death, Ranjit Singh took them under his protection in 1811 by marrying them via the rite of chādar andāzī, in which a cloth sheet was unfurled over each of their heads. The same with Roop Kaur, Gulab Kaur, Saman Kaur, and Lakshmi Kaur,  looked after Duleep Singh when his mother Jind Kaur was exiled. Ratan Kaur had a son Multana Singh in 1819, and Daya Kaur had two sons Kashmira Singh and Pashaura Singh in 1821.Jind Kaur, the final spouse of Ranjit Singh. Her father, Manna Singh Aulakh, extolled her virtues to Ranjit Singh, who was concerned about the frail health of his only heir Kharak Singh. The Maharaja married her in 1835 by 'sending his arrow and sword to her village'. On 6 September 1838 she gave birth to Duleep Singh, who became the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire.His other wives included, Mehtab Devi of Kangara also called Guddan or Katochan and Raj Banso, daughters of Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra.\nHe was also married to Rani Har Devi of Atalgarh, Rani Aso Sircar and Rani Jag Deo According to the diaries, that Duleep Singh kept towards the end of his life, that these women presented the Maharaja with four daughters. Dr. Priya Atwal notes that the daughters could be adopted. Ranjit Singh was also married to Jind Bani or Jind Kulan, daughter of Muhammad Pathan from Mankera and Gul Bano, daughter of Malik Akhtar from Amritsar.\nRanjit Singh married many times, in various ceremonies, and had twenty wives. Sir Lepel Griffin, however, provides a list of just sixteen wives and their pension list. Most of his marriages were performed through chādar andāz. Some scholars note that the information on Ranjit Singh's marriages is unclear, and there is evidence that he had many concubines. Dr. Priya Atwal presents an official list of Ranjit Singh's thirty wives. The women married through chādar andāzī were noted as concubines and were known as the lesser title of Rani (queen). While Mehtab Kaur and Datar Kaur officially bore the title of Maharani (high queen), Datar Kaur officially became the Maharani after the death of Mehtab Kaur in 1813. Throughout her life was referred to as Sarkar Rani. After her death, the title was held by Ranjit's youngest widow Jind Kaur. According to Khushwant Singh in an 1889 interview with the French journal Le Voltaire, his son Dalip (Duleep) Singh remarked, \"I am the son of one of my father's forty-six wives.\" Dr. Priya Atwal notes that Ranjit Singh and his heirs entered a total of 46 marriages. But Ranjit Singh was known not be a \"rash sensualist\" and commanded unusual respect in the eyes of others. Faqir Sayyid Vaḥiduddin states: \"If there was one thing in which Ranjit Singh failed to excel or even equal the average monarch of oriental history, it was the size of his harem.\" George Keene noted, \"In hundreds and in thousands the orderly crowds stream on. Not a bough is broken of a wayside tree, not a rude remark to a woman\".\n\nPunishment by the Akal Takht\nIn 1802, Ranjit Singh married Moran Sarkar, a Muslim nautch girl. This action, and other non-Sikh activities of the Maharaja, upset orthodox Sikhs, including the Nihangs, whose leader Akali Phula Singh was the Jathedar of the Akal Takht. When Ranjit Singh visited Amritsar, he was called outside the Akal Takht, where he was made to apologise for his mistakes. Akali Phula Singh took Ranjit Singh to a tamarind tree in front of the Akal Takht and prepared to punish him by flogging. Then Akali Phula Singh asked the nearby Sikh pilgrims whether they approved of Ranjit Singh's apology. The pilgrims responded with Sat Sri Akal and Ranjit Singh was released and forgiven. An alternative holds that Ranjit went to visit Moran on his arrival in Amritsar before paying his respects at Harmandir Sahib Gurdwara, which upset orthodox Sikhs and hence was punished by Akali Phula Singh. Iqbal Qaiser and Manveen Sandhu make alternative accounts on the relationship between Moran and the Maharaja; the former stating they never married, while the latter state that they married. Court chronicler, Sohan Lal Suri makes no mention Moran's marriage to the Maharaja or coins being struck in her name. Bibi Moran spent the rest of life in Pathankot. Duleep Singh makes a list of his father's queens which also does not mention Bibi Moran.\n\nIssue\nKharak Singh (22 February 1801 – 5 November 1840) was the eldest and the favorite of Ranjit Singh from his second and favorite wife, Datar Kaur. He succeeded his father as the Maharaja.\nIshar Singh son of his first wife, Mehtab Kaur. This prince died in infancy in 1805.\nRattan Singh (1805–1845) was born to Maharani Datar Kaur. He was granted the Jagatpur Bajaj estate as his jagir.\nSher Singh (4 December 1807 – 15 September 1843) was elder of the twins of Mehtab Kaur. He briefly became the Maharaja of the Sikh Empire.\nTara Singh (4 December 1807 – 1859) younger of the twins born of Mehtab Kaur.\nMultana Singh (1819–1846) son of Ratan Kaur.\nKashmira Singh (1821–1844) son of Daya Kaur.\nPashaura Singh (1821–1845) younger son of Daya Kaur.\nDuleep Singh (4 September 1838 – 22 October 1893), the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire. Ranji Singh's youngest son, the only child of Jind Kaur.According to the pedigree table and Duleep Singh's diaries that he kept towards the end of his life mention another son Fateh Singh was born to Mai Nakain, who died in infancy. According to Henry Edward only Datar Kaur and Jind Kaur's sons are Ranjit Singh's biological sons.It is said that Ishar Singh was not the biological son of Mehtab Kaur and Ranjit Singh, but only procured by Mehtab Kaur and presented to Ranjit Singh who accepted him as his son. Tara Singh and Sher Singh had similar rumors, it is said that Sher Singh was the son of a chintz weaver, Nahala and Tara Singh was the son of Manki, a servant in the household of Sada Kaur. Henry Edward Fane, the nephew and aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief, India, General Sir Henry Fane, who spent several days in Ranjit Singh's company, reported,\n\"Though reported to be the Maharaja's son, Sher Singh's father has never thoroughly acknowledged him, though his mother always insisted on his being so. A brother of Sher, Tara Singh by the same mother, has been even worse treated than himself, not being permitted to appear at court, and no office given him, either of profit or honour.\" Five Years in India, Volume 1\nHenry Edward Fane, London, 1842Multana Singh, Kashmira Singh and Pashaura Singh were sons of the two widows of Sahib Singh, Daya Kaur and Ratan Kaur, that Ranjit Singh took under his protection and married. These sons, are said to be, not biologically born to the queens and only procured and later presented to and accepted by Ranjit Singh as his sons.\n\nEstablishment of the Sikh Empire\nHistorical context\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire fell apart and declined in its ability to tax or govern most of the Indian subcontinent. In the northwestern region, particularly the Punjab, the creation of the Khalsa community of Sikh warriors by Guru Gobind Singh accelerated the decay and fragmentation of the Mughal power in the region. Raiding Afghans attacked the Indus river valleys but met resistance from both organised armies of the Khalsa Sikhs as well as irregular Khalsa militias based in villages. The Sikhs had appointed their own zamindars, replacing the previous Muslim revenue collectors, which provided resources to feed and strengthen the warriors aligned with Sikh interests. Meanwhile, colonial traders and the East India Company had begun operations in India on its eastern and western coasts.By the second half of the 18th century, the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and parts of north India) were a collection of fourteen small warring regions. Of the fourteen, twelve were Sikh-controlled misls (confederacies), one named Kasur (near Lahore) was Muslim controlled, and one in the southeast was led by an Englishman named George Thomas. This region constituted the fertile and productive valleys of the five rivers – Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Bias and Sutlej. The Sikh misls were all under the control of the Khalsa fraternity of Sikh warriors, but they were not united and constantly warred with each other over revenue collection, disagreements, and local priorities; however, in the event of external invasion such as from the Muslim armies of Ahmed Shah Abdali from Afghanistan, they would usually unite.Towards the end of 18th century, the five most powerful misls were those of Sukkarchakkia, Kanhayas, Nakkais, Ahluwalias and Bhangi Sikhs. Ranjit Singh belonged to the first, and through marriage had a reliable alliance with Kanhayas and Nakkais. Among the smaller misls, some such as the Phulkias misl had switched loyalties in the late 18th century and supported the Afghan army invasion against their Khalsa brethren. The Kasur region, ruled by Muslim, always supported the Afghan invasion forces and joined them in plundering Sikh misls during the war.\n\nMilitary campaigns\nRise to fame, early conquests\nRanjit Singh's fame grew in 1797, at age 17, when the Afghan Muslim ruler Shah Zaman, of the Ahmad Shah Abdali dynasty, attempted to annex Panjab region into his control through his general Shahanchi Khan and 12,000 soldiers. The battle was fought in the territory that fell in Ranjit Singh controlled misl, whose regional knowledge and warrior expertise helped resist the invading army. This victory gained him recognition. In 1798, the Afghan ruler sent in another army, which Ranjit Singh did not resist. He let them enter Lahore, then encircled them with his army, blocked off all food and supplies, burnt all crops and food sources that could have supported the Afghan army. Much of the Afghan army retreated back to Afghanistan.In 1799, Raja Ranjit Singh's army of 25,000 Khalsa, supported by another 25,000 Khalsa led by his mother-in-law Rani Sada Kaur of Kanhaiya misl, in a joint operation attacked the region controlled by Bhangi Sikhs centered around Lahore. The rulers escaped, marking Lahore as the first major conquest of Ranjit Singh. The Sufi Muslim and Hindu population of Lahore welcomed the rule of Ranjit Singh. In 1800, the ruler of Jammu region ceded control of his region to Ranjit Singh.In 1801, Ranjit Singh proclaimed himself as the \"Maharaja of Punjab\", and agreed to a formal investiture ceremony, which was carried out by Baba Sahib Singh Bedi – a descendant of Guru Nanak. On the day of his coronation, prayers were performed across mosques, temples and gurudwaras in his territories for his long life. Ranjit Singh called his rule as \"Sarkar Khalsa\", and his court as \"Darbar Khalsa\". He ordered new coins to be issued in the name of Guru Nanak named the \"NanakShahi\" (\"of the Emperor Nanak\").\n\nExpansion\nIn 1802, Ranjit Singh, aged 22, took Amritsar from the Bhangi Sikh misl, paid homage at the Harmandir Sahib temple, which had previously been attacked and desecrated by the invading Afghan army, and announced that he would renovate and rebuild it with marble and gold.\n\nOn 1 January 1806, Ranjit Singh signed a treaty with the British officials of the East India Company, in which he agreed that his Sikh forces would not attempt to expand south of the Sutlej river, and the Company agreed that it would not attempt to militarily cross the Sutlej river into the Sikh territory.In 1807, Ranjit Singh's forces attacked the Muslim ruled Kasur and, after a month of fierce fighting in the Battle of Kasur defeated the Afghan chief Qutb-ud-Din, thus expanding his empire northwest towards Afghanistan. He took Multan in 1818, and the whole Bari Doab came under his rule with that conquest. In 1819, he successfully defeated the Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers and annexed Srinagar and Kashmir, stretching his rule into the north and the Jhelum valley, beyond the foothills of the Himalayas.The most significant encounters between the Sikhs in the command of the Maharaja and the Afghans were in 1813, 1823, 1834 and in 1837. In 1813, Ranjit Singh's general Dewan Mokham Chand led the Sikh forces against the Afghan forces of Shah Mahmud led by Fateh Khan Barakzai. The Afghans lost their stronghold at Attock in that battle.\nIn 1813–14, Ranjit Singh's first attempt to expand into Kashmir was foiled by Afghan forces led by Azim Khan, due to a heavy downpour, the spread of cholera, and poor food supply to his troops.In 1818, Darbar's forces led by Kharak Singh and Misr Dewan Chand occupied Multan, killing Muzaffar Khan and defeating his forces, leading to the end of Afghan influence in the Punjab.In July 1818, an army from the Punjab defeated Jabbar Khan, a younger brother of governor of Kashmir Azim Khan, and acquired Kashmir, along with a yearly revenue of Rs seventy lacs. Dewan Moti Ram was appointed governor of Kashmir.\n\nIn 1823, Yusufzai Pashtuns fought the army of Ranjit Sing north of the Kabul River.In 1834, Mohammed Azim Khan once again marched towards Peshawar with an army of 25,000 Khattak and Yasufzai tribesmen in the name of jihad, to fight against infidels. The Maharaja defeated the forces. Yar Mohammad was pardoned and was reinvested as governor of Peshawar with an annual revenue of Rs one lac ten thousand to Lahore Darbar.In 1837, the Battle of Jamrud, became the last confrontation between the Sikhs led by him and the Afghans, which displayed the extent of the western boundaries of the Sikh Empire.On 25 November 1838, the two most powerful armies on the Indian subcontinent assembled in a grand review at Ferozepore as Ranjit Singh, the Maharajah of the Punjab brought out the Dal Khalsa to march alongside the sepoy troops of the East India Company and the British troops in India. In 1838, he agreed to a treaty with the British viceroy Lord Auckland to restore Shah Shoja to the Afghan throne in Kabul. In pursuance of this agreement, the British army of the Indus entered Afghanistan from the south, while Ranjit Singh's troops went through the Khyber Pass and took part in the victory parade in Kabul.\n\nGeography of the Sikh Empire\nThe Sikh Empire, also known as the Sikh Raj and Sarkar-a-Khalsa, was in the Punjab region, the name of which means \"the land of the five rivers\". The five rivers are the Beas, Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Jhelum, all of which are tributaries of the river Indus.The geographical reach of the Sikh Empire under Singh included all lands north of Sutlej river, and south of the high valleys of the northwestern Himalayas. The major towns at time included Srinagar, Attock, Peshawar, Bannu, Rawalpindi, Jammu, Gujrat, Sialkot, Kangra, Amritsar, Lahore and Multan.Muslims formed around 70%, Hindus formed around 24%, and Sikhs formed around 6–7% of the total population living in Singh's empire: 2694\n\nGovernance\nRanjit Singh allowed men from different religions and races to serve in his army and his government in various positions of authority. His army included a few Europeans, such as the Frenchman Jean-François Allard, though Singh maintained a policy of refraining from recruiting Britons into his service, aware of British designs on the Indian subcontinent. Despite his recruitment policies, he did maintain a diplomatic channel with the British; in 1828, he sent gifts to George IV and in 1831, he sent a mission to Simla to confer with the British Governor General, William Bentinck; while in 1838, he cooperated with them in removing the hostile Islamic Emir in Afghanistan.\n\nReligious policies\nAs consistent with many Punjabis of that time, Ranjit Singh was a secular king and followed the Sikh path. His policies were based on respect for all communities, Hindu, Sikh and Muslim. A devoted Sikh, Ranjit Singh restored and built historic Sikh Gurdwaras – most famously, the Harmandir Sahib, and used to celebrate his victories by offering thanks at the Harmandir. He also joined the Hindus in their temples out of respect for their sentiments. The veneration of cows was promoted and cow slaughter was punishable by death under his rule. He ordered his soldiers to neither loot nor molest civilians.He built several gurdwaras, Hindu temples and even mosques, and one in particular was Mai Moran Masjid, built on the behest of his beloved Muslim wife, Moran Sarkar. The Sikhs led by Singh never razed places of worship to the ground belonging to the enemy. However, he did convert Muslim mosques into other uses. For example, Ranjit Singh's army desecrated Lahore's Badshahi Mosque and converted it into an ammunition store, and horse stables. Lahore's Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) was converted into \"Moti Mandir\" (Pearl Temple) by the Sikh army, and Sonehri Mosque were converted into a Sikh Gurdwara, but upon the request of Sufi Fakir (Satar Shah Bukhari), Ranjit Singh restored the latter back to a mosque. Lahore's Begum Shahi Mosque was also used as a gunpowder factory, earning it the nickname Barudkhana Wali Masjid, or \"Gunpowder Mosque.\"Singh's sovereignty was accepted by Afghan and Punjabi Muslims, who fought under his banner against the Afghan forces of Nadir Shah and later of Azim Khan. His court was ecumenical in composition: his prime minister, Dhian Singh, was a Hindu (Dogra); his foreign minister, Fakir Azizuddin, was a Muslim; and his finance minister, Dina Nath, was also a Hindu (Brahmin). Artillery commanders such as Mian Ghausa were also Muslims. There were no forced conversions in his time. His wives Bibi Mohran, Gilbahar Begum retained their faith and so did his Hindu wives. He also employed and surrounded himself with astrologers and soothsayers in his court.Ranjit Singh had also abolished the gurmata and provided significant patronage to the Udasi and Nirmala sect, leading to their prominence and control of Sikh religious affairs.\n\nAdministration\nKhalsa Army\nThe army under Ranjit Singh was not limited to the Sikh community. The soldiers and troop officers included Sikhs, but also included Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. Hindu Brahmins and people of all creeds and castes served his army, while the composition in his government also reflected a religious diversity. His army included Polish, Russian, Spanish, Prussian and French officers. In 1835, as his relationship with the British warmed up, he hired a British officer named Foulkes.However, the Khalsa army of Ranjit Singh reflected regional population, and as he grew his army, he dramatically increased the Rajputs and the Sikhs who became the predominant members of his army. In the Doaba region his army was composed of the Jat Sikhs, in Jammu and northern Indian hills it was Hindu Rajputs, while relatively more Muslims served his army in the Jhelum river area closer to Afghanistan than other major Panjab rivers.\n\nReforms\nRanjit Singh changed and improved the training and organisation of his army. He reorganised responsibility and set performance standards in logistical efficiency in troop deployment, manoeuvre, and marksmanship. He reformed the staffing to emphasise steady fire over cavalry and guerrilla warfare, improved the equipment and methods of war. The military system of Ranjit Singh combined the best of both old and new ideas. He strengthened the infantry and the artillery. He paid the members of the standing army from treasury, instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies.While Ranjit Singh introduced reforms in terms of training and equipment of his military, he failed to reform the old Jagirs (Ijra) system of Mughal middlemen. The Jagirs system of state revenue collection involved certain individuals with political connections or inheritance promising a tribute (nazarana) to the ruler and thereby gaining administrative control over certain villages, with the right to force collect customs, excise and land tax at inconsistent and subjective rates from the peasants and merchants; they would keep a part of collected revenue and deliver the promised tribute value to the state. These Jagirs maintained independent armed militia to extort taxes from the peasants and merchants, and the militia prone to violence. This system of inconsistent taxation with arbitrary extortion by militia, continued the Mughal tradition of ill treatment of peasants and merchants throughout the Sikh Empire, and is evidenced by the complaints filed to Ranjit Singh by East India Company officials attempting to trade within different parts of the Sikh Empire.According to historical records, states Sunit Singh, Ranjit Singh's reforms focused on military that would allow new conquests, but not towards taxation system to end abuse, nor about introducing uniform laws in his state or improving internal trade and empowering the peasants and merchants. This failure to reform the Jagirs-based taxation system and economy, in part led to a succession power struggle and a series of threats, internal divisions among Sikhs, major assassinations and coups in the Sikh Empire in the years immediately after the death of Ranjit Singh; an easy annexation of the remains of the Sikh Empire into British India followed, with the colonial officials offering the Jagirs better terms and the right to keep the system intact.\n\nInfrastructure investments\nRanjit Singh ensured that Panjab manufactured and was self-sufficient in all weapons, equipment and munitions his army needed. His government invested in infrastructure in the 1800s and thereafter, established raw materials mines, cannon foundries, gunpowder and arm factories. Some of these operations were owned by the state, others operated by private Sikh operatives.However, Ranjit Singh did not make major investments in other infrastructure such as irrigation canals to improve the productivity of land and roads. The prosperity in his Empire, in contrast to the Mughal-Sikh wars era, largely came from the improvement in the security situation, reduction in violence, reopened trade routes and greater freedom to conduct commerce.\n\nMuslim accounts\nThe mid 19th-century Muslim historians, such as Shahamat Ali who experienced the Sikh Empire first hand, presented a different view on Ranjit Singh's Empire and governance. According to Ali, Ranjit Singh's government was despotic, and he was a mean monarch in contrast to the Mughals. The initial momentum for the Empire building in these accounts is stated to be Ranjit Singh led Khalsa army's \"insatiable appetite for plunder\", their desire for \"fresh cities to pillage\", and eliminating the Mughal era \"revenue intercepting intermediaries between the peasant-cultivator and the treasury\".According to Ishtiaq Ahmed, Ranjit Singh's rule led to further persecution of Muslims in Kashmir, expanding the previously selective persecution of Shia Muslims and Hindus by Afghan Sunni Muslim rulers between 1752 and 1819 before Kashmir became part of his Sikh Empire. Bikramjit Hasrat describes Ranjit Singh as a \"benevolent despot\".\nThe Muslim accounts of Ranjit Singh's rule were questioned by Sikh historians of the same era. For example, Ratan Singh Bhangu in 1841 wrote that these accounts were not accurate, and according to Anne Murphy, he remarked, \"when would a Musalman praise the Sikhs?\" In contrast, the colonial era British military officer Hugh Pearse in 1898 criticised Ranjit Singh's rule, as one founded on \"violence, treachery and blood\". Sohan Seetal disagrees with this account and states that Ranjit Singh had encouraged his army to respond with a \"tit for tat\" against the enemy, violence for violence, blood for blood, plunder for plunder.\n\nDecline\nSingh made his empire and the Sikhs a strong political force, for which he is deeply admired and revered in Sikhism. After his death, empire failed to establish a lasting structure for Sikh government or stable succession, and the Sikh Empire began to decline. The British and Sikh Empire fought two Anglo-Sikh wars with the second ending the reign of Sikh Empire. Sikhism itself did not decline.Clive Dewey has argued that the decline of the empire after Singh's death owes much to the jagir-based economic and taxation system which he inherited from the Mughals and retained. After his death, a fight to control the tax spoils emerged, leading to a power struggle among the nobles and his family from different wives. This struggle ended with a rapid series of palace coups and assassinations of his descendants, and eventually the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British.\n\nDeath and legacy\nDeath\nIn the 1830s, Ranjit Singh suffered from numerous health complications as well as a stroke, which some historical records attribute to alcoholism and a failing liver. According to the chronicles of Ranjit Singh's court historians and the Europeans who visited him, Ranjit Singh took to alcohol and opium, habits that intensified in the later decades of his life. However, he neither smoked nor ate beef, and required all officials in his court, regardless of their religion, to adhere to these restrictions as part of their employment contract.  He died in his sleep on 27 June 1839. Four of his Hindu wives- Mehtab Devi (Guddan Sahiba), daughter of Raja Sansar Chand, Rani Har Devi, the daughter of Chaudhri Ram, a Saleria rajput, Rani Raj Devi, daughter of Padma Rajput and Rani Rajno Kanwar, daughter of Sand Bhari along with seven Hindu concubines with royal titles committed sati by voluntarily placing themselves onto his funeral pyre as an act of devotion.Singh is remembered for uniting Sikhs and founding the prosperous Sikh Empire. He is also remembered for his conquests and building a well-trained, self-sufficient Khalsa army to protect the empire. He amassed considerable wealth, including gaining the possession of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani of Afghanistan, which he left to Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha in 1839.\n\nGurdwaras\nPerhaps Singh's most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the Harmandir Sahib, the most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs, which is now known popularly as the \"Golden Temple\". Much of the present decoration at the Harmandir Sahib, in the form of gilding and marblework, was introduced under the patronage of Singh, who also sponsored protective walls and water supply system to strengthen security and operations related to the temple. He also directed construction of two of the most sacred Sikh temples, being the birthplace and place of assassination of Guru Gobind Singh – Takht Sri Patna Sahib and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib, respectively – whom he much admired. The nine-storey tower of Gurdwara Baba Atal was constructed during his reign.\n\nMemorials and museums\nSamadhi of Ranjit Singh in Lahore, Pakistan, marks the place where Singh was cremated, and four of his queens and seven concubines committed sati.\nOn 20 August 2003, a 22-foot-tall bronze statue of Singh was installed in the Parliament of India.\nA museum at Ram Bagh Palace in Amritsar contains objects related to Singh, including arms and armour, paintings, coins, manuscripts, and jewellery. Singh had spent much time at the palace in which it is situated, where a garden was laid out in 1818.\nOn 27 June 2019, a nine-feet bronze statue of Singh was unveiled at the Haveli Maharani Jindan, Lahore Fort at his 180th death anniversary. It has been vandalised several times since, specifically by members of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan.\n\nCrafts\nIn 1783, Ranjit Singh established a crafts colony of Thatheras near Amritsar and encouraged skilled metal crafters from Kashmir to settle in Jandiala Guru. In the year 2014, this traditional craft of making brass and copper products got enlisted on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. The Government of Punjab is now working under Project Virasat to revive this craft.\n\nAwards\nIn 2020, Ranjit Singh was named as \"Greatest Leader of All Time\" in a poll conducted by 'BBC World Histories Magazine'.\n\nIn popular culture\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh, a documentary film directed by Prem Prakash covers his rise to power and his reign. It was produced by the Government of India's Films Division.\nIn 2010, a TV series titled Maharaja Ranjit Singh aired on DD National based on his life which was produced by Raj Babbar's Babbar Films Private Limited. He was portrayed by Ejlal Ali Khan\nMaharaja: The Story of Ranjit Singh (2010) is an Indian Punjabi-language animated film directed by Amarjit Virdi.\nA teenage Ranjit was portrayed by Damanpreet Singh in the 2017 TV series titled Sher-e-Punjab: Maharaja Ranjit Singh. It aired on Life OK produced by Contiloe Entertainment.\n\nSee also\nBaradari of Ranjit Singh\nHistory of Punjab\nCharat Singh\nHari Singh Nalwa\nList of generals of Ranjit Singh\nKoh-i-Noor\nBattle of Balakot\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nDuleep Singh\nMaharaja Sir Duleep Singh, GCSI (4 September 1838 – 22 October 1893), or Sir Dalip Singh, and later in life nicknamed the \"Black Prince of Perthshire\", was the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire. He was Maharaja Ranjit Singh's youngest son, the only child of Maharani Jind Kaur.He was placed in power in September 1843, at the age of five, with his mother ruling on his behalf, and after their defeat in the Anglo-Sikh War, under a British Resident. He was subsequently deposed by the British Crown, and thereafter exiled to Britain at age 15 where he was befriended by Queen Victoria, who is reported to have written of the Punjabi Maharaja: \"Those eyes and those teeth are too beautiful\". The Queen was godmother to several of his children. He died at 55, living most of his final years in the United Kingdom.His mother had effectively ruled when he was very young and he managed to meet her again on 16 January 1861, in Calcutta and return with her to the United Kingdom. During the last two years of her life, his mother told the Maharaja about his Sikh heritage and the Empire which once had been his to rule. In June 1861, he was one of the first 25 Knights in the Order of the Star of India.\n\nEarly years\nAfter the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839, Duleep Singh lived quietly with his mother, Jind Kaur Aulakh, at Jammu ruled by Gulab Singh, under the protection of the Vizier, Raja Dhian Singh. He and his mother were recalled to Lahore in 1843 after the assassinations of Maharaja Sher Singh and Dhian Singh, and on 16 September, at the age of five, Duleep Singh was proclaimed Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, with Maharani Jind Kaur as Regent.\nOn 13 December 1845 the British East India Company declared war on the Sikhs and, after winning the First Anglo-Sikh War, retained the Maharaja as nominal ruler, but replaced the Maharani by a Council of Regency and later imprisoned and exiled her. Over thirteen years passed before Duleep Singh was permitted to see his mother again.\nAfter the close of the Second Anglo-Sikh War and the subsequent annexation of the Punjab on 29 March 1849, he was deposed at the age of ten and was put into the care of Dr John Login and sent from Lahore to Fatehgarh on 21 December 1849, with tight restrictions on who he was allowed to meet. No Indians, except trusted servants, could meet him in private. As a matter of British policy, he was to be culturally anglicised in every possible aspect. His health was reportedly poor and he was often sent to the hill station of Landour near Mussoorie in the Lower Himalaya for convalescence, at the time about 4 days' journey. He would remain for weeks at a time in Landour at a grand hilltop building called The Castle, which had been lavishly furnished to accommodate him.\n\nConversion to Christianity\nIn 1853, under the tutelage of his long-time retainer Bhajan Lal (himself a Christian convert), he converted to Christianity at Fatehgarh with the approval of the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. His conversion remains controversial, and it occurred before he turned 15. He later had serious doubts and regrets regarding this decision and reconverted to Sikhism in 1886.He was also heavily and continuously exposed to Christian texts under the tutelage of the devout Sir John Spencer Login. His two closest childhood friends were both English Anglican missionaries. In May 1854 he was sent into exile in Britain.\n\nLife in exile\nLondon\nDuleep Singh arrived in England in late 1854 and was introduced to the British court. Queen Victoria showered affection upon the turbaned Maharaja, as did the Prince Consort. Duleep Singh was initially lodged at Claridge's Hotel in London before the East India Company took over a house in Wimbledon and then eventually another house in Roehampton which became his home for three years. He was also invited by the Queen to stay with the Royal Family at Osborne, where she sketched him playing with her children and Prince Albert photographed him, while the court artist, Winterhalter, made his portrait.He eventually got bored with Roehampton and expressed a wish to go back to India but it was suggested by the East India Company Board he take a tour of the European continent which he did with Sir John Spencer Login and Lady Login. He was a member of the Photographic Society, later the Royal Photographic Society, from 1855 until his death.\n\nCastle Menzies\nOn his return from Continental Europe in 1855 he was given an annual pension of £25,000 a year (approximately £2,500,000 in today's value) provided he \"remain obedient to the British Government,\" and was officially under ward of Sir John Spencer Login and Lady Login, who leased Castle Menzies in Perthshire, Scotland, for him. He spent the rest of his teens there, but at 19 he demanded to be in charge of his household. Eventually, he was given this and an increase in his annual pension.\nIn 1859 Lt Col James Oliphant was installed as Equerry to the Maharaja at the recommendation of Sir John Login. Oliphant was to be a possible replacement should anything happen to the Maharaja's most trusted friend Sir John Login (who did indeed die four years later in 1863).In the 1860s, Singh moved from Castle Menzies to Grandtully Castle.\n\nMulgrave Castle\nFrom 1858 to 1862 Duleep Singh rented Mulgrave Castle, near Whitby.\n\nSir Samuel White Baker\nWhile Sir Samuel White Baker was visiting the Duke of Atholl on his shooting estate in Scotland, he befriended Maharaja Duleep Singh. In 1858–1859, the two partnered an extensive hunting trip in central Europe and the Balkans, via Frankfurt, Berlin, Vienna and Budapest. On the last part of the voyage, Baker and the Maharajah hired a wooden boat in Budapest, which was eventually abandoned on the frozen Danube. The two continued into Vidin where, to amuse the Maharajah, Baker went to the Vidin slave market. There, Baker fell in love with a white slave girl, destined for the Ottoman Pasha of Vidin. Baker was outbid by the Pasha but bribed the girl's attendants. The two ran away in a carriage together and eventually, as Florence Baker, she became Baker's lover and wife and accompanied him everywhere he journeyed.\n\nReunion with his mother\nWhen he was 18, Singh wrote to his mother in Kathmandu, suggesting that she should join him in Great Britain, but his letter was intercepted by the British authorities in India and did not reach her. He then sent a courier, Pundit Nehemiah Goreh, who was also intercepted and forbidden to contact the Maharani. Duleep Singh then decided to go himself. Under cover of a letter from Login he wrote to the British Resident in Kathmandu, who reported that the Maharani had 'much changed, was blind and had lost much of the energy which formerly characterised her.' The British government decided she was no longer a threat and she was allowed to join her son on 16 January 1861 at Spence's Hotel in Calcutta and return with him to England.\n\nAuchlyne and Aberfeldy\nIn 1858 the lease of Castle Menzies expired and Duleep Singh rented the house at Auchlyne from the Earl of Breadalbane. He was known for a lavish lifestyle, shooting parties, and a love of dressing in Highland costume and soon had the nickname \"the Black Prince of Perthshire\". (At the same time, he was known to have gradually developed a sense of regret for his circumstances in exile, including some inner turmoil about his conversion to Christianity and his forced departure from the Punjab). His mother stayed in Perthshire with him for a short time, before he rented the Grandtully Estate, near Aberfeldy. Following the death of his mother and Sir John Login in 1863, he returned to England.\n\nElveden Estate\nMaharaja Duleep Singh (as he became in June 1861) bought (or the India Office purchased for him) a 17,000 acres (69 km2) country estate at Elveden on the border between Norfolk and Suffolk, close to Thetford, in 1863. He enjoyed living in Elveden Hall and the surrounding area and restored the church, cottages, and school. He transformed the run-down estate into an efficient game preserve and it was here that he gained his reputation as the fourth best shot in England.The house was remodelled into a quasi-oriental palace where he lived the life of a British aristocrat. Maharaja Duleep Singh was accused of running up large expenses and the estate was sold after his death to pay his debts. Today, Elveden is owned by The 4th Earl of Iveagh, the head of the Anglo-Irish Guinness family of brewing fame; it remains an operating farm and private hunting estate.\n\nRe-initiated into Sikhism\nIn 1864, Duleep Singh married Bamba Müller in Cairo and established his family home at Elveden Hall in Suffolk. He eventually became disaffected and embittered with the British, and he reverted to Sikhism.\nWhile in exile, he sought to learn more about Sikhism and was eager to return to India. Though previous efforts were thwarted by his handlers, he re-established contact with his cousin Sardar Thakar Singh Sandhawalia, who on 28 September 1884 left Amritsar for England along with his sons Narinder Singh and Gurdit Singh and a Sikh granthi (priest), Pratap Singh Giani. He also brought a list of properties held by Sir Duleep Singh in India. All this renewed his connection with Sikhism.The British Government decided in 1886 against his return to India or his re-embracing Sikhism. Despite protests from the India Office, he set sail for 'home' on 30 March 1886. However, he was intercepted and arrested in Aden, then part of Aden Settlement, where the writ of the Viceroy of India began. He could not be stopped from an informal re-conversion ceremony in Aden, far less grand and symbolic than it would have been in India, done by emissaries sent by Sardar Thakar Singh Sandhawalia, who was earlier planning the Pahaul ceremony at Bombay. Sir Duleep was forced to return to Europe.\n\nDeath\nMaharaja Duleep Singh died in Paris in 1893 at the age of 55, having seen India after the age of fifteen during only two brief, tightly controlled visits in 1860 (to bring his mother to England) and in 1863 (to cremate his mother's body).\nMaharaja Duleep Singh's wish for his body to be returned to India was not honoured, in fear of unrest, given the symbolic value the funeral of the son of the Lion of the Punjab might have caused and the growing resentment of British rule. His body was brought back to be buried according to Christian rites, under the supervision of the India Office, in Elveden Church beside the grave of his wife Maharani Bamba, and his son Prince Edward Albert Duleep Singh. The graves are located on the west side of the Church.\n\nA life-size bronze statue of the Maharaja, showing him on a horse, was unveiled by the then Prince of Wales in 1999 at Butten Island in Thetford, a town which benefited from his and his sons' generosity.In an auction at Bonhams, London, on 19 April 2007, the 74 cm high white marble portrait bust of Maharaja Duleep Singh by Victorian sculptor John Gibson, R.A., in Rome in 1859 fetched £1.7 million (£1.5 million plus premium and tax).A film titled Maharaja Duleep Singh: A Monument Of Injustice, was made in 2007, directed by P.S. Narula.\n\nHeraldry\nThe Maharaja and his family used a coat of arms which was drawn up by Prince Albert, despite not being registered at the College of Arms. It contained a coronet, lions, and a shield with a cross, along with the motto \"Prodesse quam conspicii\" (\"to do good rather than be conspicuous\").\n\nFamily\nSir Duleep Singh married twice, first to Bamba Müller in 1864, and then to Ada Douglas Wetherill (1869-1930) in 1889. He had eight children in total.\nHe had seven children from his marriage to Bamba. Their first child and male heir died aged one day in 1865. The others were:\n\nPrince Victor Albert Jay Duleep Singh (10 Jan 1866-7 Jun 1918)\nPrince Frederick Victor Duleep Singh (23 Jan 1868-15 Aug 1926)\nPrincess Bamba Sofia Jindan Duleep Singh (29 Sep 1869-10 Mar 1957)\nPrincess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh (27 Oct 1871-8 Nov 1942)\nPrincess Sophia Alexandra Duleep Singh (8 Aug 1876-22 Aug 1948)\nPrince Albert Edward Alexander Duleep Singh (1879-1 May 1893)He also had two children from his marriage to Wetherill:\n\nPrincess Pauline Alexandra Duleep Singh (26 Dec 1887-10 Apr 1941)\nPrincess Ada Irene Beryl Duleep Singh (25 Oct 1889-14 Sep 1926)All the eight children died without legitimate issue, ending the direct line of the Sikh Royalty.There is a memorial at Eton College in England to Princes Victor and Frederick, Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh's two sons who studied at Eton in the 1870s.\n\nMaharani Bamba Müller\nMaharani Bamba Müller was an Arabic-speaking, part-Ethiopian, part-German woman, whose father was a German banker and whose mother was an Abyssinian Coptic Christian slave. She and Sir Duleep met in Cairo in 1863 on his return from scattering his mother's ashes in India; they were married in Alexandria, Egypt, on 7 June 1864. The Maharani died in London on 18 September 1887.\n\nAda Douglas Wetherill\nAda Douglas Wetherill (born 15 January 1869 in Kennington, Surrey, the daughter of a civil engineer) had been Duleep's mistress before he decided to return to India with his family, and upon being stopped in Aden by the British authorities he abandoned his family and moved to Paris, where she joined him. They married in Paris on 28 April 1889. She stayed with him through his years in Paris and also travelled with him to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he failed to persuade the Czar of the benefits of invading India through the north and reinstalling him as ruler. She died in Sussex on 6 August 1930.\nQueen Victoria and Maharaja Duleep Singh reconciled their differences before he died. Out of loyalty to Maharani Bamba, the Queen refused to receive Ada, whom she suspected had been involved with the Maharaja before Maharani Bamba's death in 1887.\n\nMiscellany\nIn 1854, Madame Blavatsky, the founder of the  Theosophical Society, met her Master Morya in England, who was in her words, \"in the company of a dethroned native prince\". This \"native prince\" according to general consent was Sir Duleep Singh.\nHe was a member of the Freemasons and was admitted into the lodge in 1861.On 21 October 1893, the day before Sir Duleep Singh's death, Prince Victor Duleep Singh, the eldest son of Sir Duleep Singh, had visions of his father looking at him through a picture frame.\nDuleep Singh remembered his servant James Cawood who died in 1865 with a gravestone in Killin cemetery, Killin, Scotland.A 2017 film, The Black Prince, by the Indian-born film director Kavi Raz told the story of Duleep and his relationship with Queen Victoria.\nMaharaja Duleep Singh's character is featured in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed: Syndicate game. He is featured as a young Duleep Singh, which based on his real-life struggle as an exiled ruler in Victorian London.\n\nFurther reading\nSikh History in 10 Volumes, by Dr Harjinder Singh Dilgeer.

He made 75 appearances for the club in the Midland League and five appearances in the FA Cup before joining Stockport County in 1925, where he made no league appearances.\nPassage 9:\nBamba Müller\nMaharani Bamba, Lady Singh (Bamba Müller; 6 July 1848 – 18 September 1887). Brought up by Christian missionaries, she married Maharaja Duleep Singh and became Maharani Bamba, wife of the last Maharaja of Lahore. Her transformation from illegitimate girl, born to a German father and Abyssinian (Ethiopian) mother, living in a Cairo mission to a Maharani living a life of luxury with the \"Black Prince of Perthshire\" has been compared to the \"Cinderella\" story.\n\nBiography\nBamba Müller was the daughter of Ludwig Müller, a German merchant banker with the company Todd Müller and Co., by his mistress of Abyssinian descent called Sofia. The name Bamba was Arabic for pink. Her father already had a wife and he therefore placed his illegitimate daughter in the care of missionaries in Cairo. Her father had requested and paid for her education, and remained in contact with the missionaries. Müller became an enthusiastic and charismatic member of the Christian community and was the only female in a select group of communicants at the American Presbyterian Mission school in Cairo.\n\nThe prince\nDuleep Singh was the last ruler of the Sikh Empire, being dethroned by the East India Company after the Second Anglo-Sikh War. In 1863, Singh was being supervised in Britain where he was a friend of Queen Victoria and kept a large social circle. He was known as the \"Black Prince of Perthshire\" around his home in Scotland. Singh was given money by the East India Company administration on condition that he complied with the demands of the British government. Duleep had been taken to Britain when a child and raised as a Christian. This was after he had been persuaded to agree to the annexation of the Punjab by the East India Company. The treaty also included handing the Koh-i-Nor diamond as well, which became part of the Crown Jewels. Singh was separated from his mother, Maharani Jindan Kaur. His mother remained in India, although eventually she was allowed to rejoin her son in England. Duleep collected her after special permission was given. Duleep was allowed by the East India Company to visit India for the second time to bury his mother after she died in Britain, although the body remained at Kensal Green Cemetery for nearly a year whilst this was negotiated upon. His mother's ashes were not allowed to be buried in Lahore (the main city of the Punjab), but had to be placed in a memorial in Bombay instead.\n\nThe proposal\nOn his return from Bombay Duleep passed through Cairo and visited the missionaries there on 10 February 1864. He visited again a few days later and was taken around the girls' school, where he first met Bamba Müller, who was an instructor. She was the only girl there who had committed herself to a Christian life. On each visit Duleep made presents to the mission of several hundreds of pounds.\nDuleep Singh wrote to the teachers at the missionary school at the end of the month in the hope that they would recommend a wife for him as he was to live in Britain and he wanted a Christian wife of Eastern origin. Queen Victoria had told Duleep that he should marry an Indian princess who had been educated in England, but he desired a girl with less sophistication. The final proposal had to be done via an intermediary as Duleep did not speak Arabic, Müller's only language.  The missionaries discussed this proposal with Müller. She was unsure whether to accept the proposal offered via the missionaries. Her first ambition was to rise to teach children in a missionary school. Her father was consulted but he left the choice to his daughter. Müller eventually made her decision after praying for guidance. She decided that the marriage was God's call for her to widen her ambitions. Singh made a substantial contribution of one thousand pounds to the school and married Müller on 7 June 1864 in the British Consulate in Alexandria, Egypt. The ceremony was described as brief, with few witnesses. Both of them wore European dress though Duleep wore a turban. Bamba wore simple jewellery including pearls. She had a short sleeved, moire, antique dress, orange blossoms in her hair, and a veil. The Prince made his vows in English, whilst Bamba spoke in Arabic.\n\nFamily and death\nThe couple had three sons and three daughters whom they brought up at Elveden Hall in Suffolk, England. Her six children were: Victor Albert Jay (1866–1918), Frederick Victor (1868–1926), Bamba Sophia Jindan  (1869–1957), Catherina Hilda (1871–1942), Sophia Alexandra (1876–1948), and Albert Edward Alexander (1879–1893).\nVictor and Frederick both joined the British Army whilst Frederick became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. One of her daughters, Bamba Sophia Jindan, returned to Lahore as the wife of a Dr Sutherland. She was known as Princess Bamba Sutherland.\nIn 1886 her husband resolved to return to India. On his way there he was arrested in Aden and forced to return to Europe. Bamba died on 18 September 1887 and was buried  at Elveden. The cause of death was reported as \"comprehensive renal failure brought on by an acute case of diabetes, made worse by her drinking (of alcohol)\".Bamba's husband went on to marry again in 1889 to Ada Douglas Wetherill and had two more children.\nHer son Albert Edward Alexander Duleep Singh died aged thirteen in Hastings on 1 May 1893 and was buried next to his mother. When Bamba's husband died, his body was brought back to England and buried with his wife and son at Elveden.", "answers": ["27 June 1839"], "length": 10742, "dataset": "2wikimqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "70923ff731dcad518ecdcdc8b53e165e8515a96ecf8f23c7"}

He is best known for the films he made with his third wife Anna Neagle.\n\nEarly life\nWilcox's mother was from County Cork, Ireland, and Wilcox considered himself Irish, but he was born in Norwood, south London. His family moved to Brighton when Wilcox was eight years old; he was one of five children.\nHis family were poor and Wilcox had to do a number of part-time jobs, including some work as a chorus boy at the local Hippodrome. His mother died of tuberculosis when she was 42. Wilcox left school before the age of fourteen to find work. Shortly afterwards, his father died at the age of 42. Wilcox began earning money as a professional pool player at the Metropole in Camberwell Green.\nThe First World War broke out and Wilcox enlisted in the army. He was training cadets in County Cork when the Easter Rising broke out in 1916 and Wilcox was wounded. He then enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps to earn more money and trained as a pilot. A case of appendicitis kept him away from the front for a time but he wound up serving in France and serving as a flight instructor in England.\n\nFilm career\nAfter the war, Wilcox went to work for his brother Charles as a film salesman. He began selling American films to Yorkshire exhibitors, occasionally working with Victor Saville.\n\nAstra Films\nIn 1919, Wilcox used his war gratuity to found his own distribution company, Astra Films, in association with his brother and a colleague, Jack Smart. Wilcox contributed £117, and the others made up the rest. It was based in Yorkshire. \"Owing to the war, there were practically no British productions\", said Wilcox. \"They were almost all American films.\" The company was immediately successful so they expanded into London.\n\nGraham-Wilcox Productions\nAstra had a lot of success with a British film, A Peep Behind the Scenes (1919) so Wilcox decided to produce a British film himself. He raised £1,400 to make The Wonderful Story (1922). It was directed by a Newcastle exhibitor who shared Wilcox's enthusiasm for D. W. Griffith, Jack Graham Cutts; he and Wilcox established Graham-Wilcox Productions. Wilcox sold the film for £4,000 and the premiere got excellent reviews. This enabled Wilcox to raise funds for a slate of films, before The Wonderful Story was released and flopped at the box office.However the next Graham-Wilcox production, Flames of Passion (1922), starring imported Hollywood star Mae Marsh was a big hit, among the first British films sold to the USA. The success of the film inspired Wilcox to steer away from realistic drama and focus on escapist entertainment.\n\nDirector\nWilcox optioned the screen rights for Chu-Chin-Chow (1923), with imported American star Betty Blythe.  The film was shot in Germany at UFA's studios in association with Eric Pommer with a huge budget but was only a moderate success. He followed it with Southern Love (1924), shot in Vienna, again with Blythe. Wilcox launched the film with a mock bull fight in Albert Hall and says the film returned a profit in England alone.Pommer asked Wilcox to collaborate again and they made Decameron Nights (1924).\nBack in Britain he made Paddy the Next Best Thing (1923).\nAfter what he described as a \"series of unimpressive films\" he made The Only Way (1926), based on a stage play which was based on A Tale of Two Cities.He followed it with Nell Gwyn (1926), starring Dorothy Gish in the title role. This was a big success around the world.\n\nBritish National Films\nThe world rights to Nell Gwyn were purchased by British National Films, a company established by J.D. Williams, who signed Wilcox and Gish to make three more films, all financed by Paramount:  Madame Pompadour (1926), the first film shot at the newly built Elstree Studios; London (1926); and Tip Toes (1927). It was later revealed in a court case that Wilcox's fee was £3,000 a film plus 25% of the profits, but there were no profits for the three films.\n\nBritish and Dominions Film Corporation\nWilcox ended up leaving British National and founded the British and Dominions Film Corporation with Nelson Keys with capital of half a million pounds. HIs first film for them, via Herbert Wilcox Productions, was Mumsie (1927), starring Pauline Frederick and, in his debut, Herbert Marshall.\nWilcox wanted to make another film with Frederick and suggested Noël Coward's The Vortex but Frederick disliked the role. Wilcox instead decided to do a version of the Edith Cavell story, Dawn (1928). Frederick dropped out of the film, and was replaced by Sybil Thorndike. Filming proved difficult but the resulting movie was a big hit. In 1928 British and Dominion Films insured Wilcox for £100,000.There was some talk he would make a film of the Burke and Wills story. Instead he made what he described as \"a series of unimportant but profitable films\": The Bondman (1929), The Woman in White (1929),\n\nSound Films\nGenerally, Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail is regarded as the first film with sound, but Wilcox's Black Waters was trade-shown several weeks earlier in May, 1929.He produced more than a hundred films, of which he directed about half.  \"His film production team were never laid off, even during the worst depressions of the British film industry. They were on full salary 52 weeks of the year.\"Wilcox built and equipped sound studios next to the British International Pictures studios, which they bought from John Maxwell. Wilcox signed up top stage artists such as Jack Buchanan, Tom Walls and Ralph Lynn and Sydney Howard, with C.B. Cochran and Albert de Courville as producers. He announced plans to make nine talkies.He produced and directed the first British all talkie ever made, Wolves (1930), with Charles Laughton and Dorothy Gish and produced Canaries Sometimes Sing (1930).He made an arrangement to produce a series of films in association with His Master's Voice gramophone company, with the aim of using their celebrity recording stars. Among the films they were to make together were Cochran's Talkie Revue, a film of C.B Cochran's variety show; the play Rookery Nook; an adaptation of the novel The Blue Lagoon, and the life story of Robert Burns.However their first movie, The Loves of Robert Burns (1930), with Joseph Hislop, was not a success and the arrangement abruptly ended. Wilcox's plans to make The Life of Beethoven and a version of Don Quixote starring Chaliapin had to be cancelled.Wilcox produced Rookery Nook (1930), an Aldwych farce based on the play by Ben Travers and directed by Tom Walls. It led to a series of Aldwych farces from Travers and Walls.\nHe acted as producer only on  Splinters (1930), high Treason (1930, The Mountain of Mourne (1930), Warned Off (1930), On Approval (1930), Tons of Money (1930), Mischief (1931), The Speckled Band (1931), Plunder (1931), Almost a Divorce (1931), Up for the Cup (1931) with Sydney Howard, The Barton Mystery (1932), Life Goes On (1932), Thark (1932), Leap Year (1932), It's a King (1932),The Love Contract (1932), Say It with Music(1932),  The Mayor's Nest (1932), and A Night Like This (1932).\nAs a director he made The Chance of a Night Time (1931) with Ralph Lynn from a play by Ben Travers; Carnival (1931); and The Blue Danube (1933).\n\nAnna Neagle\nWilcox's professional relationship with Anna Neagle began when he was looking for a leading lady to support Jack Buchanan in Goodnight, Vienna (1932). He decided to cast her after seeing Neagle support Buchanan on stage in a musical Stand Up and Cheer. Goodnight Vienna was Wilcox's biggest success to that time.He used Neagle again in The Flag Lieutenant (1932)\nHe made some films without her – Money Means Nothing (1932), The King's Cup (1933), General John Regan (1933), The Blarney Stone (1933), The King of Paris (1933), Lord of the Manor (1933), Discord (1933) – then they were reunited on The Little Damozel (1933), a conscious effort on Wilcox's part to ensure that Neagle was not type cast as an \"English Rose\".He bought the rights to a John Galsworthy play Loyalties and developed a screenplay. He later sold it to William Fox for a profit. He produced That's a Good Girl (1933).\nBitter Sweet (1933) starred Neagle, based on the operetta by Noël Coward. It was a box office failure.Yes, Mr Brown (1933) was a vehicle for Jack Buchanan and Lilies of the Field (1934) without her. Wilcox was back to Neagle for The Queen's Affair (1934). He and Neagle had a big hit with a new version of Nell Gwynn (1934). They followed it with Peg of Old Drury (1935).\nHe also produced Escape Me Never (1935), starring Elisabeth Bergner, which was a surprise box office hit.\n\nHerbert Wilcox Productions\nThe success of Peg of Old Drury saw Wilcox approached by Lord Portal to set up his own company, Herbert Wilcox Productions. Wilcox resigned from British Dominion, and set up the new company with C.M. Woolf and J. Arthur Rank. The only other shareholders in the company apart from Wilcox were Woolf and his brother Maurice.\nWilcox, Woolf, Portal and Rank soon established themselves as a major player in the industry by buying Universal Pictures' English operations; Wilcox was appointed to the board to directors of Universal English and the Universal American parent company. He also had shares in a new company, General Cinema Finance, which was to control the distribution and production of films and acquire cinemas. This company would go on to acquire Gaumont British and the Odeon circuit and form the back bone of the Rank Film empire.Their first film was Street Singer Serenade (1936), aka Limelight, directed by Wilcox with Neagle and Jack Buchanan. It was followed by Fame (1936), which he produced, starring Sydney Howard and new Wilcox discovers Miki Hood and Geraldine Hislop. He and Neagle did a story about trapeze artists, Three Maxims (1936).He made Where's George? (1936) with Sydney Howard.\nWilcox was back with Buchanan with This'll Make You Whistle (1936). He wanted to make an epic version of The Blue Lagoon with Hollywood stars to be shot mostly on location in Hawaii and a biopic of Lady Hamilton with Neagle but neither was made. Instead he made Millions (1937).\nWilcox's film studio at Elstree burnt down and Wilcox moved to new studios at Pinewood. There he made London Melody (1937) with Neagle.\n\nRKO\nWilcox wanted to star Neagle in a biopic of Queen Victoria. Woolf refused to finance it, believing it to be a bad investment, so Wilcox raised the bulk of the finance himself. Wilcox invested his entire savings and Neagle put in £10,000. They secured a distribution agreement with RKO. Victoria the Great (1937) was a massive success and led to Wilcox signing a ten-year deal with RKO to help finance and distribute the films.He and Neagle promptly made a sequel, Sixty Glorious Years (1938). Wilcox produced but did not direct A Royal Divorce (1938) starring Ruth Chatterton. Wilcox announced he would make a biopic of Lord Kitchener but the film was never made.\n\nHollywood\nHe and Neagle went to the US to work for RKO. They looked into making a biopic of Marie Lloyd but could not find a suitable co-star for Neagle so instead made another biopic, Nurse Edith Cavell (1939). They were going to follow it with a biopic of Flora MacDonald filmed in Scotland but the declaration of war made that impossible. Instead they made three musicals: Irene (1940), with Ray Milland; No, No, Nanette (1940), with Victor Mature; and Sunny (1941) with Ray Bolger. They were among the many names who worked on Forever and a Day (1943).\nIn July 1941, Wilcox and Neagle returned to England to make They Flew Alone (1942) a biopic of Amy Johnson and the war thriller Yellow Canary (1943).\n\nThe London Films\nWilcox and Neagle had a big hit with I Live in Grosvenor Square (1945), co starring Rex Harrison and Dean Jagger. They followed it with Piccadilly Incident (1946), starring Neagle and Michael Wilding, which was even more popular, the second biggest British hit of 1946. Wilcox signed Wilding to a long-term contract.\nThe Courtneys of Curzon Street (1947) was the most popular film at the British box office in 1947. Another hit was Spring in Park Lane (1948).\nWilding was not in their next film, Elizabeth of Ladymead (1948) but returned for Maytime in Mayfair (1949), a sequel to Spring in Park Lane, and another massive success.\nWilcox and Neagle returned to war stories with Odette (1950) a biopic of Odette Samson starring Neagle and Trevor Howard, and Wilcox's most profitable movie to date. He planned to make a biopic about Van Gogh starring Trevor Howard, but it was never made.Wilcox made a film without Neagle, Into the Blue (1950), with Wilding and Odile Versois; it was not particularly popular. Neagle and Wilding were reunited for The Lady with a Lamp (1951), a biopic of Florence Nightingale and Derby Day (1952), an ensemble film. Both did well at the box office but not as well as the late 40s films.\n\nMargaret Lockwood and Republic Pictures\nIn the early 1950s Neagle had a long running stage hit, The Glorious Years. In November 1951 Wilcox signed a multi picture deal with Margaret Lockwood to make six films in three years. The following year he signed a six-picture deal with Republic Films.\nThe first movie Lockwood-Wilcox film, Trent's Last Case (1952) was a solid success, helped by a cast including Wilding and Orson Welles. However Laughing Anne (1953), co-starring Forrest Tucker and Wendell Corey, and Trouble in the Glen (1954), with Welles, did poorly and he made no further films with Lockwood or Republic.\nWilcox was further hurt when a film he produced, The Beggar's Opera (1953), was a box office disaster.\n\nErrol Flynn and Ivor Novello\nWilcox formed a new production company, Everest, and made two musicals with Neagle and Errol Flynn: Lilacs in the Spring (1954), based on The Glorious Years, and King's Rhapsody (1955), based on a musical by Ivor Novello. Both flopped and plans to make a third Novello film, Perchance to Dream did not happen.\n\nLast films\nWilcox had a hit with My Teenage Daughter (1956), a story of Neagle dealing with a juvenile delinquent daughter played by Sylvia Syms. Less successful was These Dangerous Years (1957), produced by Neagle and directed by Wilcox, starring George Baker and Frankie Vaughan, and no Neagle.\nHe produced but did not direct a war film,  Yangtse Incident (1957), which performed reasonably well at the British box office but ultimately lost money. Wilcox found himself personally liable for some of the film's costs.\nHe tried a drama with Neagle, The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1958), and three films with Vaughan: Wonderful Things! (1958), The Heart of a Man (1959), and The Lady Is a Square (1959).\n\nBankruptcy\nWilcox was plagued with financial troubles in the 1950s and 1960s. He missed an early opportunity to invest in television; Anna Neagle's chain of dancing schools failed; he and Neagle invested heavily in British Lion shares and the company went into receivership; he borrowed £341,000 from the Edgware Trust; he and Neagle had guaranteed a £75,000 loan to make the two Errol Flynn films; and he paid £100,000 to Terence Rattigan for the film rights to his play Ross only for him to be unable to get it made.  His film company failed in the 1960s. He spent two years trying to make a film about King Edward VII but the Queen refused permission. He was declared bankrupt in 1964, owing £16,000 to the Edgware Trust and £134,313 over all.However, the musical play Charlie Girl, starring his wife Anna Neagle, ran for five years and resolved this financial situation.Wilcox made some money from writing articles and was discharged as a bankrupt in 1966 after paying about 4 1/2 d in the pound to creditors.According to one profile \"The conventional view of Wilcox is that, despite his eventual bankruptcy, his considerable entrepreneurial skills enabled him to sustain a continued presence over a long period in a notoriously unstable industry; discussion of his directorial qualities usually acknowledges his professionalism but falls short of crediting him with any authorial status.\"\n\nPersonal life\nIn June 1917, Herbert Wilcox was granted a divorce from his first wife Dorothy, whom he had married on 2 December 1916 at St Luke's (CoE), Brighton.  At the time, Herbert Wilcox was a lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps.  His wife was \"carrying on a disgraceful intrigue\" with an also-married Mr. Stanley Steel.  The jury awarded Wilcox damages, possibly shared with Mrs Steel, of £750 plus costs.In 1920, Wilcox married Maude Bower; they had four children together. Wilcox married his third wife, actress Anna Neagle, on 9 August 1943. The couple remained married until Wilcox's death in 1977, but they had no children.\nPrior to his death at the age of 87 in London, England after a long illness, Wilcox donated four Daily Mail National Film Awards to the Glebelands Retirement Home in Wokingham.\nWilcox is buried in the City of London Cemetery.\n\nAwards\nIn 1937, the Wilcox film Victoria the Great was nominated for the Mussolini Cup at the Venice Film Festival, but lost out to the French film Life Dances On (Un carnet de bal). Wilcox lost the Festival's Best Director award to Robert J. Flaherty and Zoltán Korda for Elephant Boy. However, Victoria the Great and Wilcox won the Festival's Nations Cup for \"Best World Premiere\".\nWilcox won four Daily Mail National Film Awards.\n\n1947 – Best Film – Piccadilly Incident (producer and director)\n1948 – Best Film – The Courtneys of Curzon Street (producer and director)\n1949 – Best Film – Spring in Park Lane (producer and director)\n1951 – Best Film – Odette (producer and director)\n\nSelected filmography\nDirector\nChu-Chin-Chow (1923)\nSouthern Love (1924)\nDecameron Nights (1924)\nNell Gwyn (1926)\nLondon (1926)\nMumsie (1927)\nMadame Pompadour (1927)\nTip Toes (1927)\nThe Only Way (1927)\nDawn (1928)\nThe Bondman (1929)\nThe Woman in White (1929)\nSplinters (1929)\nThe Loves of Robert Burns (1930)\nThe Chance of a Night Time (1931)\nCarnival (1931)\nThe Blue Danube (1932)\nGood Night, Vienna (1932)\nMoney Means Nothing (1932)\nThe King's Cup (1932)\nThe Little Damozel (1933)\nBitter Sweet (1933)\nYes, Mr. Brown (1933)\nThe Queen's Affair (1934)\nNell Gwynn (1934)\nPeg of Old Drury (1935)\nWhere's George?

It was made at British and Dominions Imperial Studios, Elstree and Pinewood Studios  by Wilcox's independent production company and distributed by J. Arthur Rank's General Film Distributors. It was also released with the alternative title Look Out for Love.\nIt was the first movie shot at Pinewood.\n\nSynopsis and production\nA musical with a trial. One of several Anna Neagle - Tullio Carminati vehicles of the era, London Melody was one of five films directed within a year or so by Neagle's future husband, Herbert Wilcox. This time around, Carminatti is cast as Marius Andreani, a cultured Italian diplomat. While in London on business, Marius makes the chance acquaintance of boisterous cockney street entertainer Jacqueline (Neagle). It is love at first sight, but hero and heroine must undergo a dizzying series of roadblocks and misunderstandings before the climactic clinch. Meanwhile, Jacqueline rises to the top of show-business success, never dreaming (until the end, at least) that it is all the secret handiwork of faithful Marius.\nBritish and Dominions Imperial Studios was destroyed by fire in the early morning of 9 February 1936, necessitating the move of the production to Pinewood.\n\nCast\nCritical reception\nIn 1937, The Sydney Morning Herald called it an \"attractive and well-acted picture...Produced and directed by Herbert Wilcox in a way that contrasts favourably with Hollywood's efforts in a similar direction...Anna Neagle, a gifted actress, with definite charm and personality, makes a delightful Jacqueline. As the diplomat...Tulllo Carminati lends distinction and poise to his role. Perhaps the best character in the film is the priest, Horace Hodges, a lovable and very human person. Robert Douglas makes a good impression in the rather inconsistent part of Nigel Taplow, Andreani's secretary\"; whereas more recently, Sky Movies described it as \"a very thin musical vehicle for Anna Neagle, bizarrely cast as a cockney street singer. This dated offering...will prove tough going for all but hardened Neagle fans today.\"\nPassage 6:\nRavina (actress)\nRavina is an Indian actress who acted in Dhallywood movies. She acted in the 1997 film Praner Cheye Priyo with Riaz. She also appeared in Sabdhan and Dolopoti, again opposite Riaz.\n\nSelected filmography\nPraner Cheye Priyo\nSabdhan\nDolopoti\nPassage 7:\nQuerelle\nQuerelle is a 1982 West German-French English-language arthouse film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Brad Davis, adapted from French author Jean Genet's 1947 novel Querelle of Brest. It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno Pöschl as Robert / Gil\nGünther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau – \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 8:\nClaude Chabrol\nClaude Henri Jean Chabrol (French: [klod ʃabʁɔl]; 24 June 1930 – 12 September 2010) was a French film director and a member of the French New Wave (nouvelle vague) group of filmmakers who first came to prominence at the end of the 1950s. Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine Cahiers du cinéma before beginning his career as a film maker.\nChabrol's career began with Le Beau Serge (1958), inspired by Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in Les Biches (1968), La Femme infidèle (1969), and Le Boucher (1970) – all featuring Stéphane Audran, who was his wife at the time.\nSometimes characterized as a \"mainstream\" New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in Violette Nozière. On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful Madame Bovary (1991) and La Cérémonie (1995). Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that \"there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper, if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium...Some of his films become almost private jokes, made to amuse himself.\" James Monaco has called Chabrol \"the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave, and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we don't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard.\"\n\nLife and career\nEarly life\nClaude Henri Jean Chabrol was born on 24 June 1930 to Yves Chabrol and Madeleine Delarbre in Paris and grew up in Sardent, France, a village in the region of Creuse 400 km (240 miles) south of Paris. Chabrol said that he always thought of himself as a country person, and never as a Parisian. Both Chabrol's father and grandfather had been pharmacists, and Chabrol was expected to follow in the family business. But as a child, Chabrol was \"seized by the demon of cinema\" and ran a film club in a barn in Sardent between the ages of 12 and 14. It was at this time that he developed his passion for the thriller genre, detective stories and other forms of popular fiction.\n\nEarly years in Paris\nAfter World War II, Chabrol moved to Paris to study pharmacology and literature at the Sorbonne, where he received a licence en lettres. Some biographies also state that he briefly studied law and political science at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques. While living in Paris Chabrol became involved with the postwar cine club culture and frequented Henri Langlois's Cinémathèque Française and the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin, where he first met Éric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut and other future Cahiers du Cinéma journalists and French New Wave filmmakers. After graduating, Chabrol served his mandatory military service in the French Medical Corps, serving in Germany and reaching the rank of sergeant. Chabrol has said that while in the army he worked as a film projectionist. After he was discharged from the army, he joined his friends as a staff writer for Cahiers du Cinéma, who were challenging then-contemporary French films and championing the concept of Auteur theory. As a film critic, Chabrol advocated realism both morally and aesthetically, mise-en-scene, and deep focus cinematography, which he wrote \"brings the spectator in closer with the image\" and encourages \"both a more active mental attitude on the part of the spectator and a more positive contribution on his part to the action in progress.\" He also wrote for Arts magazine during this period. Among Chabrol's most famous articles were \"Little Themes\", a study of genre films, and \"The Evolution of Detective Films\".In 1955 Chabrol was briefly employed as a publicity man at the French offices of 20th Century Fox, but was told that he was \"the worst press officer they'd ever seen\" and was replaced by Jean-Luc Godard, who they said was even worse. In 1956 he helped finance Jacques Rivette's short film Le coup du berger, and later helped finance Rohmer's short Véronique et son cancre in 1958. Unlike all of his future New Wave contemporaries, Chabrol never made short film nor did he work as an assistant on other directors' work before making his feature film debut. In 1957 Chabrol and Eric Rohmer co-wrote Hitchcock (Paris: Éditions Universitaires, 1957), a study of the films made by director Alfred Hitchcock through the film The Wrong Man. Chabrol had said that Rohmer deserves the majority of the credit for the book, while he mainly worked on the sections pertaining to Hitchcock's early American films, Rebecca, Notorious, and Stage Fright. Chabrol had interviewed Hitchcock with François Truffaut in 1954 on the set of To Catch a Thief, where the two famously walked into a water tank after being starstruck by Hitchcock. Years later, when Chabrol and Truffaut had both become successful directors themselves, Hitchcock told Truffaut that he always thought of them when he saw \"ice cubes in a glass of whiskey.\"\n\n1957–67: Early film career\nThe most prolific of the major New Wave directors, Chabrol averaged almost one film a year from 1958 until his death. His early films (roughly 1958–1963) are usually categorized as part of the New Wave and generally have the experimental qualities associated with the movement; while his later early films are usually categorized as being intentionally commercial and far less experimental. In the mid-sixties it was difficult for Chabrol to obtain financing for films so he made a series of commercial \"potboilers\" and spy spoofs, which none of the other New Wave filmmakers did.Chabrol had married Agnès Goute in 1952 and in 1957 his wife inherited a large sum of money from relatives. In December of that year Chabrol used the money to make his feature directorial debut with Le Beau Serge. Chabrol spent three months shooting in his hometown of Sardent using a small crew and little known actors. The film's budget was $85,000. The film starred Jean-Claude Brialy as François and Gérard Blain as Serge, two childhood friends reunited when the recent medical school graduate François returns to Sardent and discovers that Serge has become an alcoholic after the stillbirth of his physically retarded first child. Despite suffering from tuberculosis, François drags Serge through a snowstorm to witness the birth of his second child, thus giving Serge a reason to live while killing himself in the process. Le Beau Serge is considered the inaugural film of the French New Wave Film movement that would peak between 1959 and 1962. Chabrol was the first of his friends to complete a feature film (although Jacques Rivette had already begun filming his first feature Paris nous appartient), and it immediately received critical praise and was a box office success. It won the Grand Prix at the Locarno Film Festival and the Prix Jean Vigo. Critics noticed similarities to Hitchcock's films, such as the motifs of doubling and re-occurrences and the \"Catholic guilt transference\" that Chabrol had also written about extensively in his and Rohmer's book the year earlier. Chabrol stated that he made the film as a \"farewell to Catholicism\", and many critics have called his first film vastly different from any of his subsequent films.Chabrol quickly followed this success up with Les Cousins in 1958. The film is a companion piece and a reversal to Le Beau Serge in many ways, such as having the responsible student Brialy now play the decadent and insensitive Paul while the reckless Blain now plays the hard-working law student Charles. In this film, the country cousin Charles arrives in the big city of Paris to live with his corrupt cousin Paul while attending school. This was the first of many Chabrol films to include characters named Paul and Charles, and later films would often include a female named Hélène. More so than his first film, Les Cousins features many characteristics that would be seen as \"Chabrolian\", including the Hitchcock influence, a depiction of the French bourgeoisie, characters with ambiguous motives and a murder. It was also Chabrol's first film co-written with his longtime collaborator Paul Gégauff, of whom Chabrol once said \"when I want cruelty, I go off and look for Gégauff. Paul is very good at gingering things up...He can make a character look absolutely ridiculous and hateful in two seconds flat.\" Les Cousins was another box office success in France and won the Golden Bear at the 9th Berlin International Film Festival.Chabrol formed his own production company AJYM Productions (acronym based on the initials of his wife's and children's names) at the time of making Le Beau Serge.  After the success of Le Beau Serge and Les Cousins, Chabrol began funding many of the films of his friends. AJYM helped fund Eric Rohmer's feature debut The Sign of Leo, partially funded Rivette's Paris nous appartient, and Philippe de Broca's films Les Jeux de l'amour and Le farceur. He also donated excess film stock from Les Cousins to Rivette to complete Paris nous appartient. Chabrol was also a technical advisor on Jean-Luc Godard's feature debut Breathless and acted in small parts in many of his friends' and his own early films. For his support to the early careers of so many of his friends, Chabrol has been referred to as \"the godfather of the French New Wave\", although many film histories tend to overlook this contribution and dismiss Chabrol altogether.After two box office hits in a row, Chabrol was given a big budget to make his first color film, À double tour (Léda) in the spring of 1959. The film stars Jean-Paul Belmondo as Laszlo and Antonella Lualdi as Léda, two outsiders of a bourgeois family who experience different results when attempting to enter that family. Chabrol adapted the script with Paul Gégauff from a novel by Stanley Ellin, and the film is known for its oedipal sex triangle and murder scenario. The film was shot on location in Aix-en-Provence with cinematographer Henri Decaë and includes choppy, hand-held camera footage that is atypical of a Chabrol film despite being present in many of the New Wave films made at the same time. The film was both a box office and critical disappointment, and critic Roy Armes criticized \"Chabrol's lack of feeling for his characters and love of overacting.\"In 1960 Chabrol made what is considered by many critics as his best early film, Les Bonnes Femmes. The film stars Bernadette Lafont, Clotilde Joano, Stéphane Audran and Lucile Saint-Simon as four Parisian appliance store employees who all dream of an escape from their mediocre lives, and the different outcomes for each girl. Most critics praised the film, such as Robin Wood and James Monaco. However some left-wing critics disliked Chabrol's depiction of working-class people and accused him of making fun of their lifestyles. The film was another box office disappointment for Chabrol. It was followed with two films that were also financially unsuccessful and which Chabrol has admitted to making purely for \"commercial reasons\". Les Godelureaux was made in 1960 and hated by Chabrol. The Third Lover (L'Œil du Malin), released in 1961, received better reviews than Chabrol's previous films, with critics pointing out that the films that Chabrol wrote without Paul Gégauff were much more compassionate and realistic than the ones with Gégauff. It was shot on location in Munich. Although she had appeared in supporting roles in several Chabrol films before, The Third Lover was the first Chabrol film in which Stéphane Audran appeared as the female lead. They later married in 1964 and worked together until the late 1970s.In 1962 Chabrol made Ophelia, a loose adaptation of Hamlet that was another box office disappointment. Later that year he had a minor hit film with Landru, written by Françoise Sagan and starring Charles Denner, Michèle Morgan, Danielle Darrieux and Hildegard Knef. The film depicts the famous French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru, a story that had previously inspired Charlie Chaplin's film Monsieur Verdoux.From 1964 to 1967 Chabrol made six films and one short that were critically and commercially disastrous, and this period is considered a low point of his career. Four of these films were in the then-popular genre of spy spoof films, including Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche and Le Tigre se parfume à la dynamite. Chabrol had said that \"I like to get to the absolute limit of principles...In drivel like the Tiger series I really wanted to get the full extent of the drivel. They were drivel, so OK, let's get into it up to our necks.\" During this period a Variety headline read \"Vital To Keep Making Pictures, and What Sort Not Relevant; Chabrol No 'Doctrinaire' Type.\" In 1965 Chabrol also contributed to the New Wave portmanteau film Six in Paris with the segment \"La Muette\". Chabrol co-starred with Stéphane Audran as a middle aged couple dealing with their rebellious teenage daughter. In 1964 Chabrol also directed a stage production of MacBeth for the Théâtre Récamier.\n\n1968–78: \"Golden Era\"\nIn 1968 Chabrol began working with film producer André Génovès and started to make more critically acclaimed films that would later be considered his \"Golden Era\". Most of these films revolved around themes of bourgeois characters and a murder is almost always part of the plot. Unlike his earlier films, most of these films centered around middle aged people. Chabrol often worked with the same people during this period including actors Audran and Michel Bouquet, cinematographer Jean Rabier, editor Jacques Gaillard, sound technician Guy Chichignoud, composer Pierre Jansen, set designer Guy Littaye, as well as producer Génovés and co-writer Paul Gégauff.In 1968 Chabrol made Les Biches, one of his most acclaimed works. The film stars Stéphane Audran as the dominant and bisexual Frédérique, who finds a young protege in the bisexual Why (Jacqueline Sassard), until they both become the lover of a young architect named Paul (Jean-Louis Trintignant). Why ends up killing Frédérique, but it is unclear whether she murdered her cheating lover or the person that her lover was cheating with. The film received critical praise and was a box office hit. Chabrol followed this with a similar film The Unfaithful Wife (La Femme infidèle), in which a husband named Charles murders the lover of his cheating wife. It was later remade in 2002 by director Adrian Lyne. Chabrol finished the decade with This Man Must Die (Que la bête meure) in 1969. Based on an original story by Cecil Day-Lewis, in the film Charles (Michel Duchaussoy) plots to kill Paul (Jean Yanne) after Paul killed Charles' son in a hit and run car accident. However the film's ending is left intentionally ambiguous, and Chabrol has stated that \"you'll never see a Charles kill a Paul. Never.\" The film was especially praised for its landscape cinematography.In 1970 Chabrol made The Butcher (Le boucher) starring Jean Yanne and Stéphane Audran. Yanne plays Popaul, a former war hero known for his violent behavior, much like that depicted in the prehistoric cave drawings that the characters look at in their Périgord community. The French newspaper Le Figaro called it \"the best French film since the liberation.\" After another examination of bourgeois life in The Breach (La Rupture) in 1970, Chabrol made Just Before Nightfall (Juste avant la nuit) in 1971. The film stars Michel Bouquet as an ad executive named Charles who kills his mistress but cannot handle the guilt, so he confesses his crime to her husband (François Périer) and his wife (Stéphane Audran), expecting their condemnation. To his surprise they are only compassionate and forgiving to his crime and Charles cannot find relief from the guilt of what he has done. Later in 1971 Chabrol made Ten Days' Wonder (La Décade prodigieuse), based on a novel by Ellery Queen. The film was shot in English and starred Michel Piccoli, Anthony Perkins and Orson Welles. It received poor critical reviews. He followed this with the equally disliked Dr. Popaul, starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Mia Farrow. Critics compared the film unfavorably with Chabrol's earlier film that centered on a \"Landru-like\" theme. Critic Jacques Siclier said that \"the novelty of Docteur Popaul comes from the offhandedness with which the criminal history is treated.\"Chabrol took a slight change of pace with his 1973 film Wedding in Blood (Les Noces rouges) by making his first film with political themes. The film stars Audran and Michel Piccoli as lovers who plot to murder Audran's husband, who is the corrupt gaullist mayor of their town. To their surprise the President of France orders that no investigation be made of the mayor's death, leading the murdering couple to suspect political interest in their crime. In the spring of 1973 the French government banned the film for one month, allegedly so that it would not influence members of the jury of a controversial criminal trial. Chabrol followed this political theme with Nada, in which a group of young anarchists kidnap an American ambassador. It was Chabrol's first film to not center on the bourgeois since Le Beau Serge. Chabrol returned to more familiar ground in 1975 with A piece of pleasure (Une partie de plaisir). In this film screenwriter Paul Gégauff plays a writer with a troubled marriage that ends in tragedy. (In 1983, Gégauff was stabbed to death in real life by his second wife.) Gégauff's wife is played by his real-life first wife Danièle Gégauff (already divorced when this film was made) and his daughter is played by real life daughter Clemence Gégauff. The film received poor critical reviews, with Richard Roud calling it \"rather interestingly loathsome.\"Chabrol ended his Golden Period with one of his most admired and his most controversial films Violette Nozière in 1978. The film starred a young Isabelle Huppert as a real life Parisian girl from a respectable petit-bourgeois family in the 1930s. At night Violette sneaks out to pick up men and eventually contracts syphilis, which she convinces her parents must be hereditary before she kills them. The film was controversial in France but praised in other countries.\n\n1979–2009: Later work\nIn the 1980's and 1990's Chabrol engaged himself with many different projects for both TV and the silver screen. His films Poulet au vinaigre (1985) and Masques (1987) were entered into the 38th Cannes Film Festival and 37th Berlin International Film Festival respectively. Madame Bovary (1991) was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design. It was also entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. La Cérémonie (1995) is perhaps his most acclaimed film from this period, as it was nominated for numerous César Awards and was entered into the 52nd Venice International Film Festival among other. His 1999 film The Color of Lies was entered into the 49th Berlin International Film Festival.In 1995 Chabrol was awarded the Prix René Clair from the Académie française for his body of work.\nChabrol continued directing films and TV series well into the 2000's.\n\nPersonal life\nChabrol's first marriage to Agnès Goute (1956–1962) produced a son, Matthieu Chabrol, a composer who scored most of his father's films from the early 1980s. He divorced Agnès to marry the actress Stéphane Audran, with whom he had a son, actor Thomas Chabrol. They remained married from 1964 to 1978. His third wife was Aurore Paquiss, who has been a script supervisor since the 1950s. He had four children. Chabrol was a known gourmet chef and shot 10 Days Wonder in Alsace only because he wanted to visit its restaurants. Although he acknowledges the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work, Chabrol has stated that \"others have influenced me more. My three greatest influences were Murnau, the great silent film director...Ernst Lubitsch and Fritz Lang.\"Chabrol died on 12 September 2010 of leukemia. He is buried in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in north-eastern Paris.\n\nFilmography\nAs director\nAs actor\nTV work\nHistoires insolites (1974), 5 episodes\nNouvelles de Henry James (1974), 2 episodes – based on stories by Henry James\nIl était un musicien (1978), 3 episodes\nMadame le juge (1978), 1 episode\n\"Jeunesse et Spiritualité\" Cyprien Katsaris (1979) Official site\nFantômas (1980), 2 episodes – Remake of Fantômas\nLe système du docteur Goudron et du professeur Plume (1981) – based on The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether by Edgar Allan Poe\nLes affinités électives (1982) – based on Elective Affinities by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\nM. le maudit (1982, short)\nLa danse de mort (1982) – based on The Dance of Death by August Strindberg\nLes dossiers secrets de l'inspecteur Lavardin (1988), 2 episodes\nLes redoutables (2001), 1 episode\nChez Maupassant (2007), 2 episodes – based on stories by Guy de Maupassant\nAu siècle de Maupassant: Contes et nouvelles du XIXème siècle (2010), 2 episodes\nPassage 9:\nLe Masque de la Méduse\nLe masque de la Méduse (English: The Mask of Medusa) is a 2009 fantasy horror film directed by Jean Rollin. The film is a modern-day telling of the Greek mythological tale of the Gorgon and was inspired by the 1964 classic Hammer Horror film of the same name and the 1981 cult classic Clash of the Titans.

However, in 2009, Rollin began preparation foe Le masque de la Méduse. Rollin originally directed the film as a one-hour short, which was screened at the Cinémathèque de Toulouse, but after the release, Rollin decided to add 20 minutes of additional scenes and then cut the film into two distinct parts, as he did with his first feature, Le Viol du Vampire.  The film was shot on location at the Golden Gate Aquarium and Père Lachaise Cemetery, as well as on stage at the Theatre du Grande Guignol, which is where the longest part of the film takes place. It was shot on HD video on a low budget of €150,000. Before the release, it was transferred to 35mm film.\n\nRelease\nThe film was not released theatrically, although it premiered on 19 November 2009 at the 11th edition of the Extreme Cinema Film Festival at the Cinémathèque de Toulouse. As part of \"An Evening with Jean Rollin\", it was shown as a double feature with Rollin's 2007 film La nuit des horloges.\n\nHome media\nNo official DVD was released, although for a limited time, a DVD of La masque de la Méduse was included with the first 150 copies of Rollin's book Jean Rollin: Écrits complets Volume 1.\nPassage 10:\nThulasi (1987 film)\nThulasi is a 1987 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by Ameerjan.

{"input": "Which film has the director who was born first, Perdón, Viejita or Smokey And The Bandit?", "context": "Passage 1:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 – 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of Hāwera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876–77 and 1877–78, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877–78 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877–78, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896–97, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 2:\nSmokey and the Bandit Part 3\nSmokey and the Bandit Part 3 is a 1983 American action comedy film and a second and final sequel to Smokey and the Bandit (1977) and Smokey and the Bandit II (1980), starring Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Paul Williams, Pat McCormick, Mike Henry and Colleen Camp. The film also includes a cameo near the end by the original Bandit, Burt Reynolds.\nWith one of the main titular characters missing, the plot of the film revolves instead around Sheriff Buford T. Justice (\"Smokey\"), with the presence of the Bandit merely being suggested through him being impersonated by Cledus (\"Snowman\").\nThe film received negative reviews and was a box office bomb.\n\nPlot\nBig Enos and Little Enos offer retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice a wager, betting $250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from Florida to Texas. Buford rejects the wager and retires, but goes through all sorts of mishaps before finally realizing retirement is not all it is cracked up to be and accepting the Enoses' wager. Buford picks up the fish and starts driving with his son, Junior.\nThe Enoses set many traps, but Buford dodges all of them, so they try to hire the Bandit to intercept him. Agreeing that the original Bandit is too hard to manage, they hire the Snowman to act as the Bandit. The new Snowman/Bandit parks his truck so he can drive a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.\nThe Bandit picks up Dusty, who quits her job at a used car dealership. The Bandit catches up with Buford and steals the fish with Dusty's help. Buford pursues the Bandit, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation. Both police cars are disabled in the chase.\nBuford catches up after the Bandit and Dusty stop at a redneck bar to eat. The chase then creates mass chaos in a local town. The Bandit escapes when an 18-wheeler blocks the alleyway where the Bandit sped through. While trying to get the truck out, Buford's car is towed, but he reverses the car and escapes. The tow truck driver chases him, with Junior spinning on the hook. Buford makes the truck flip over, sending Junior flying through the air. Other cars crash into the pile-up.\nBuford chases the Bandit in the Mississippi Fairgrounds. Buford's car is thrown up on two side wheels by an incline, but he continues the pursuit while driving on two wheels.\nThat night, the Bandit and Dusty stop at a hotel called the Come On Inn, where people are involved in an orgy. Buford sees the Bandit's Trans-Am parked there and searches for the fish, which he finds. Buford also thinks he finds the Bandit in the sauna, but it turns out to be a muscular woman who bonds with him.\nThe next day, one of Buford's tires are blown by the \"Enos Devil Darts\". The Bandit retakes the fish. Buford pursues on the remaining three tires, first through a herd of cattle, then through parked boats, then a nudist camp, then through a field where the Enoses set off explosions, one of which destroys the car except the engine, seat, and lights, the latter of which Junior is holding above his head.\nThe Bandit intends to surrender the fish and let Buford win. As Buford collects his money, he sees the Snowman. Thinking he is dealing with the real Bandit, he resists \"the Bandit's\" (imagined as Burt Reynolds) attempts to sweet-talk him out of capturing him before Junior (in a voiceover) reminds him of what is in store for him if he retires. Buford and the Bandit both separately come to the same conclusion that they need each other in order to have meaning in their lives and the chase resumes, with Buford giving the Bandit a five-minute head start and with the muscular woman joining up with him. Junior is left behind and chases after Buford and the woman, dropping all the money in the process.\n\nCast\nJackie Gleason as Montague County Sheriff Buford T.

Contemporary newspapers refer to original plans to feature Gleason as both \"Smokey\" and \"the Bandit\", and Reed's name does not appear in early promotional materials or newspaper accounts during the film's production.  According to some accounts, Jackie Gleason was to play two roles: Sheriff Buford T. Justice and a different \"Bandit\". The original version was shot in October 1982. Reportedly test audiences reacted poorly, finding Gleason's two roles confusing, so the studio opted to do re-shoots in April 1983.  The Bandit scenes were re-shot with Jerry Reed playing the role. Other accounts indicate that the title was more literal: that Gleason was to play only Sheriff Justice, but the character would also fill the role of \"the Bandit\", by taking the Enos family's challenge (as Reynolds' character had done in the previous two films). In a teaser trailer for the film (billed as Smokey IS the Bandit), Gleason appears in character as Justice, explaining to the audience that to defeat the Bandit he would adopt the attributes of his prey, \"becoming [my] own worst enemy\". A publicity still of Gleason apparently shows him in costume as the Bandit.\n\nSoundtrack\nSmokey and the Bandit Part 3: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on vinyl and cassette tape by MCA Records in 1983.\n\nReception\nSmokey and the Bandit Part 3 received negative reviews by critics and the film was generally regarded as the weakest of the three Bandit films in terms of both storyline and revenue. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 17% based on reviews from six critics.Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a negative review: \"The already skimpy running time of Smokey and the Bandit, Part 3 is padded by an opening montage of earlier Smokey scenes, including shots of Burt Reynolds lounging in a zebra-print hammock. He is grinning, as well he might, because he has been able to sit out Part 3 altogether. What has he missed? An interminable car chase punctuated by dumb stunts and even dumber dialogue, plus the well-worth-missing sight of Paul Williams in a dress\". Variety magazine staff wrote: \"The sense of fun in that original is missing and the countless smashups and near-misses are orchestrated randomly\".\nDespite the enormous financial success of the original film (grossing over $300 million on a budget of less than $5 million), coupled with respectable (though significantly lower) numbers generated by the sequel, the third installment was both a critical and box office flop, grossing only $7 million against the film's $9 million production budget.\nPassage 3:\nSmokey Bites the Dust\nSmokey Bites the Dust is a 1981 car chase film from New World Pictures directed by Charles B. Griffith.  Despite the title, the film is not connected to the Smokey and the Bandit series.\n\nPlot\nThe stock plot deals with Roscoe Wilton (Jimmy McNichol), a teenage joyriding car thief, evading Cyco County Sheriff Turner (Walter Barnes) and his unintelligent deputies.\nTurner becomes even more obsessed with catching Roscoe after he kidnaps his overly-sheltered daughter, Peggy Sue (Janet Julian), just as she is about to be crowned Homecoming Queen during a football game at their high school.  In so doing, Roscoe also makes himself a target of other characters, including his best friend Harold (John Blyth Barrymore), Peggy Sue's friend Cindy (Kari Lizer), and Kenny (William Forsythe), a sanctimonius quarterback who is deeply, but vainly, in love with Peggy Sue.\nWhile Roscoe is being chased by Sheriff Turner, Turner himself incurs the wrath of neighboring Knotsie County Sheriff Sherm Bleed after commandeering one of Bleed's cruisers.  Turner's pursuit of Roscoe (and Peggy Sue, who quickly begins to enjoy being in Roscoe's company) goes through two other neighboring counties, with Turner commandeering several other police cruisers and civilian cars only to wreck each one in spectacular fashion.\n\nSubplots\nLester (Patrick Campbell), a local moonshiner is looking to sell his \"secret formula\" to an Arab oil sheik for \"a million clams\"; the deal falls through when it turns out the sheik brought actual clams instead of money.\nHarold and Cindy share a car as they join in the chase; Harold to get his dad's car back from Roscoe, and Cindy to give Peggy Sue her crown.  As the chase progresses, Harold and Cindy begin to fall for one another, similar to Roscoe and Peggy Sue.\nAt a nearby truck stop, a preteen girl is willing to let Roscoe and Peggy Sue steal her father's station wagon (with boat in tow) in exchange for a carton of cigarettes.  The girl appears several times more throughout the film, including near the end when everyone converges on Snake Lake Beach in a chaotic free-for-all; watching from a distance, the girl muses, \"What, I ask you, is the point in growing up?\".\nKenny's infatuation with Peggy Sue motivates him to chase the elusive couple on his own in an attempt to rescue her; he even goes so far as to run other police cruisers off the road just so he can save Peggy Sue himself.  After the fight on the beach, Kenny is eventually \"arrested\" by the female sheriff of neighboring Belladonna County.\n\nCast\nJimmy McNichol as Roscoe Wilton\nJanet Julian as Peggy Sue Turner\nWalter Barnes as Sheriff Hugh \"Smokey\" Turner\nPatrick Campbell as Lester\nKari Lizer as Cindy\nJohn Blyth Barrymore as Harold\nWilliam Forsythe (credited as 'Bill Forsythe') as Kenny\nKedric Wolfe as Deputy Bentley\nCharles Howerton as Sheriff Sherman \"Sherm\" Bleed\nTony Cox as Desk Clerk\n\nProduction\nThough the majority of the cars used in filming had California licence plates, the exact location of the storyline was more ambiguous; film dialogue mentioned the boonies, which generally refers to the Appalachian region, and also mentioned running off to \"east St. Louis or west to Colorado\".  Near the end of the film, Roscoe suggests they hotwire a boat and take off for St. Louis or New Orleans, both of which are on the Mississippi River.\nCharles B. Griffith had made a popular film for Roger Corman's New World Pictures called Eat My Dust! (1976). Corman wanted Griffith to make a follow up called Car Wars using stunt footage from five old New World films. Griffith wrote a script which he later called Wham Bam, Merci, Madame, which he says Corman rejected. However a few years later he reactivated the project.\n\nHe called again and offered me a lot more money than he ever had before. I guess I got flattered, and I went ahead and did it. He had Max Apple in Texas go ahead and write a script around all the wrecks and chases. But Max wasn't allowed to see the footage. It was too expensive to rent a Movieola and send Max prints or anything else, so he had only vague descriptions written down on what the stunts were—and nothing worked. So I made a lot of changes in it, and that made Roger angry. He tried to cut it just to the action of the old pictures, but he couldn't, because he needed all the distribution rights. Then he cut all the motivations and all the character development. It was a mess, a jumbled mess!\nApple later described the experience: \"They wanted four or five crashes, of which they already had the footage. It was more bricklaying than writing.\nPassage 4:\nSmokey and the Bandit\nSmokey and the Bandit is a 1977 American action comedy film starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Pat McCormick, Paul Williams and Mike Henry.\nThe directorial debut of stuntman Hal Needham, the film follows Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Reed), two bootleggers attempting to illegally transport 400 cases of Coors beer from Texarkana to Atlanta. While the Snowman drives the truck carrying the beer, the Bandit drives a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am to distract law enforcement (called blocking) and keep the attention off the Snowman. During their run, they are pursued by Texas county sheriff Buford T. Justice (Gleason).\nSmokey and the Bandit was the second-highest-grossing domestic film of 1977 in the United States.\n\nPlot\nWealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette and his son Little Enos have sponsored a racer in Atlanta's Southern Classic and want to celebrate in style when he wins, so they are seeking a trucker willing to bootleg Coors Beer to Atlanta for their refreshment. They find local legend Bo \"Bandit\" Darville at a truck rodeo at Lakewood Fairgrounds and offer him $80,000 to haul 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana (the closest place it could be legally sold at that time) to Atlanta in 28 hours. The Bandit takes the bet on the risky and unprecedented task, and recruits his brother-in-law Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow to drive the truck, while Bandit drives a black Pontiac Trans Am bought in advance from the Burdettes as a \"blocker\" to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo.\nThe pair arrive in Texarkana one hour early and load up the truck, but just as they head back, Carrie, a runaway bride, intercepts Bandit and jumps in his car, unwittingly making him an indirect target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice, a career Texas lawman whose witless son Junior was to have married Carrie. Buford, with Junior along, engages in a high-speed pursuit and doggedly chases Bandit all the way to Georgia to retrieve Carrie and arrest the Bandit, while various comical mishaps cause his cruiser to disintegrate on the way.\nBandit attracts more police attention across Dixie as Snowman barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer, but they are helped en route by many colorful characters via CB radio. Neither Buford nor any other lawmen know of Snowman's illegal manifest, while Bandit is likewise unaware that Buford is chasing him because of Carrie, whose jumpiness inspires Bandit to give her the CB handle \"Frog\".\nJust after re-entering Georgia, Snowman is rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a Georgia State Patrol motorcycle trooper, as state and local police intensely pursue Bandit with roadblocks and a helicopter to track his movement. With four miles left, Bandit, discouraged by the unexpected mounting attention, is ready to give up, but Snowman, who initially thought they would fail, takes the lead and smashes through the roadblock at the fairgrounds' main entrance. They return with ten minutes remaining on their time limit, but instead of taking the payoff, Carrie and Bandit accept a double-or-nothing offer from Little Enos: a challenge to run up to Boston and bring back clam chowder in 18 hours. They quickly escape in one of Big Enos's 13 Cadillacs as police flood the racetrack.\nAfter passing Buford's badly damaged cruiser on the roadside, Bandit gets on the CB and initially directs him to the Burdettes, but then respectfully gives his real location—right behind Buford, who continues his chase leaving Junior behind, and with more parts falling off his cruiser as he limps off after Bandit.\n\nCast\nBurt Reynolds as Bo \"The Bandit\" Darville\nSally Field as Carrie \"Frog\"\nJerry Reed as Cledus \"The Snowman\" Snow\nJackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T.

Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously, being better known in the film industry as a stuntman. He obtained the attention of studios and aimed the film at a more mainstream release after his friend Reynolds read the script and agreed to portray the Bandit, with Reed now portraying the Bandit's friend the Snowman. Reed would eventually play the Bandit in Smokey and the Bandit Part 3, in which Reynolds only appeared in a cameo near the end. At the time, Reynolds was the top box office star in the world.\nIn the original script, Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. The Bandit's car was a second-generation Trans Am and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000. Reynolds revealed in his autobiography that Needham had written the first draft script on legal pads. Upon showing it to his friend, Reynolds told Needham that it was the worst script he had ever read, but that he would still make the movie. Most of the dialogue was improvised on set.Universal Studios bankrolled Smokey and the Bandit for $5.3 million, figuring it was a good risk. Just two days before production was to begin, Universal sent a \"hatchet man\" to Atlanta to inform Needham that the budget was being trimmed by $1 million. With Reynolds' salary at $1 million, Needham was left with only $3.3 million to make the film. Needham and assistant director David Hamburger spent 30 hours revising the shooting schedule.\"Buford T. Justice\" was the name of a real Florida Highway Patrolman known to Reynolds' father, who was once Police Chief of Riviera Beach, Florida. His father was also the inspiration for the word \"sumbitch\" used in the film, a variation of the phrase \"son-of-a-bitch\" that, according to Reynolds, he uttered quite often. Gleason was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. It was his idea to have Junior alongside him throughout the film. In particular, the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in a roadside diner (a \"choke and puke\" in CB lingo) was not in the original story but was rather Gleason's idea.\nThe film's theme song, \"East Bound and Down\", was written virtually overnight by Reed. He gave Needham a preview of the song and, getting no reaction, offered to rewrite it. In response, Needham told Reed that he liked the song so much that if Reed changed even a word or a note, Needham would \"choke him\". It would become one of Reed's biggest hits and his signature song.The film features the custom clothing and costuming of Niver Western Wear of Fort Worth, Texas. Niver provided much of the western attire worn in the film, as well as the custom-made sheriff's uniforms (waist size 64\") that Gleason wore throughout the film.\nWhile made to take advantage of the ongoing 1970s CB radio fad, the film added to the craze. Though the film Moonrunners (1975) is the precursor to the television series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979–1985), from the same creator and with many identical settings and concepts, the popularity of Smokey and the Bandit and similar films helped get the Dukes series on the air. Three actors from the main cast of The Dukes of Hazzard appear in small uncredited roles in Smokey and the Bandit: Ben Jones, John Schneider, and Sonny Shroyer (who played a police officer in both). In return, Reynolds portrayed Boss Hogg (originally portrayed by Sorrell Booke) in the film adaptation The Dukes of Hazzard (2005). Reynolds is referenced by name in several early episodes of the series.\n\nCasting\nBefore Gleason was cast in the film, Richard Boone was originally considered for the role of Buford T. Justice. Sally Field only accepted the part after her agent advised her that she needed a big movie role on her résumé. Universal executives initially resisted casting Field, claiming she was not attractive enough, but Reynolds insisted on her involvement. Field enjoyed making the film, but remembers that virtually the entire project was improvised.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography of the film began on August 30, 1976. The movie was primarily filmed in Georgia, in the cities of McDonough, Jonesboro, and Lithonia. The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between Fayetteville and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes, Mundy's Mill Road, Main Street in Jonesboro, Georgia State Route 400, I-85 (Pleasant Hill exit) and in McDonough. However, the scene where they drive through the Shell gas station was filmed in Ojai, California, on the corner of Ojai Avenue and El Paseo Road. Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity. The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at Lakewood Speedway at the old Lakewood Fairgrounds on Atlanta's south side. The roller coaster in the movie was the Greyhound. It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film. It was destroyed in Smokey and the Bandit II and in a flashback scene in Part 3. The area around Helen, Georgia, was used for some locations. The scene where Sheriff Justice's car has the door knocked off by a passing semi-truck was shot on Georgia State Route 75, 3 miles (4.8 km) north of Helen. The tow truck driver was a local garage owner, Berlin Wike. Reynolds and Field began dating during the filming.According to an interview with Susie McIver Ewing on The RetroZest Podcast, she was picked to play the role of Hot Pants Hilliard after the dailies footage (shot in the Atlanta area) of the original actress playing the role was inadvertently destroyed on its way from Atlanta to Los Angeles. The new Hot Pants scene had to quickly be refilmed as a part of a second unit in the San Fernando Valley and was shot at a drive-in restaurant near Hansen Dam named Baby Beef Burgers, which has since been demolished. This same restaurant was used for a scene in the 1983 Stephen King Movie Christine, which was ultimately cut in the final film (it can be viewed as a deleted scene on the DVD release of the film).\n\nVehicles\nHal Needham saw an advertisement for the soon-to-be-released 1977 Pontiac Trans Am and knew right away that it would be the Bandit's car, or, as Needham referred to it, a character in the movie. He contacted Pontiac and an agreement was made that four 1977 Trans Ams and two Pontiac LeMans four-door sedans would be provided for the movie. The Trans Ams were actually 1976-model cars with 1977 front ends (from 1970 to 1976, both the Firebird/Trans Am and Chevrolet Camaro have two round headlights and in 1977, the Firebird/Trans Am was changed to four rectangular headlights, and the Camaro remained unchanged). The decals were changed to 1977-style units, as evidenced by the engine size callouts on the hood scoop being in liters rather than cubic inches, as had been the case in 1976. The hood scoop on these cars says \"6.6 LITRE\", which, in 1977, would have denoted an Oldsmobile 403-equipped car or a non-W-72, 180 hp version of the 400 Pontiac engine.\nThe cars were 1976 models, the engines fitted to them were 455ci power plants, the last year these engines were offered for sale before withdrawal. All four of the cars were badly damaged during production, one of which was all but destroyed during the jump over the dismantled Mulberry bridge. The Trans Am used for said jump was equipped with a booster rocket, the same type that was used by Evel Knievel during his failed Snake River Canyon jump. Needham served as the driver for the stunt (in place of Reynolds), while Lada St. Edmund was in the same car (in place of Field). By the film's ending, the final surviving Trans Am and LeMans were both barely running and the other cars had become parts donors to keep them running. This gives rise to various continuity errors with Justice's patrol car, which during some chase sequences is shown with a black rear fender, which then reverts to the car's bronze color again in later scenes. When it is finally torn off along with the car's roof in the impact with the girder, the missing fender still reappears later on in the film. The Burdettes' car is a 1974 Cadillac Eldorado convertible painted in a \"Candy Red\" color scheme and is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie and in the final scene as the Bandit, the Snowman, Fred the dog, and Frog use it to make their escape. Three Kenworth W900A short-frame semi trucks, driven by Reed, were each equipped with 38-inch sleepers. Two units were 1974 models, as evidenced by standard silver Kenworth emblems on the truck grille, and one unit was a 1973 model, as evidenced by the gold-painted Kenworth emblem on the truck's grille, signifying Kenworth's 50 years in business. The paint code for each truck was coffee brown with gold trims and the 48-foot (15 m) mural trailer used was manufactured by Hobbs Trailers in Texas with a non-operational Thermo King Refrigeration unit. This is obvious, because there is no fuel tank on the underside of the trailer to power the refrigeration unit, and the unit is never heard running.\n\nLegal status of Coors beer\nIn 1977, Coors was unavailable for sale east of Oklahoma. Its lack of additives and preservatives meant that Coors could spoil in one week without refrigeration, explaining the film's 28-hour deadline. A 1974 Time magazine article explains that Coors was so coveted for its lack of stabilizers and preservatives, and Coors Banquet Beer had a brief renaissance. Future President Gerald Ford, after a trip to Colorado, hid it in his luggage to take it back to Washington, D.C. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a steady supply airlifted by the Air Force to Washington. Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox would bring several cases after playing on the West Coast, by stashing them in the equipment trunks on the team's plane. Frederick Amon smuggled it from Colorado to North Carolina and sold it for four times the retail price.Coors is still brewed just outside Denver, Colorado. It is now sold in all states as Coors ships it in refrigerated train cars and bottled locally and sold in different parts of the country including the eastern US states.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe theme music \"East Bound and Down\" was sung and co-written by Reed (credited under his birth name, Jerry Hubbard) and Dick Feller. It became Reed's signature song and is on multiple albums, including Country Legends and his live album Jerry Reed \"Live!\" (Still). In 1991, it was arranged for orchestra by Crafton Beck and recorded by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra for their album Down on the Farm. Several other groups, such as the U.S. rock band Tonic and U.K.-based country cover band We Be Ploughin' have also covered it. Reed also penned and performed the song for the opening credits, entitled \"The Legend\", which tells of some of the Bandit's escapades before the events of the film, and the ballad \"The Bandit\", which is in several versions in the movie and on the soundtrack. Bill Justis is the first name on the credits for the soundtrack, as he composed and arranged original music throughout the film. Musicians such as Beegie Adair and George Tidwell played on the soundtrack. Five-string banjo player Bobby Thompson is prominent toward the end of \"East Bound and Down\". The soundtrack album was released in 1977 on vinyl, cassette, and 8-track through MCA Records.\n\nTrack listing\nReception\nBox office\nSmokey and the Bandit was a sleeper hit. It premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, where it performed badly. It then opened in just the South of the United States over the Memorial Day weekend and grossed $2,689,851 in 386 theaters. By the end of June, it had played in major Southern markets, including Charlotte, Atlanta, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Memphis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City, grossing $11.9 million. It opened in other Northern states at the end of July. With an original budget of $5.3 million (cut to $4.3 million two days before initial production), the film eventually grossed $126,737,428 in North America, making it the second-highest-grossing movie of 1977 (only Star Wars earned more, with $221.3 million). The worldwide gross is estimated at over $300 million. Reynolds said in 2015 that he most enjoyed this film, and had the most fun making it, of his career.\n\nCritical response\nCritical reception was largely positive. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 78% rating based on 32 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Not much in the head but plenty beneath the hood, Smokey and the Bandit is infectious fun with plenty of car wrecks to keep your eyes glued\".Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a good rating (3 stars out of a possible 4) and characterized it as \"about as subtle as The Three Stooges, but a classic compared to the sequels and countless rip-offs which followed\". In his review in the Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel gave the film two stars and complained that the film failed to tell the audience when the clock started on the beer run, thus reducing suspense. He claimed that the Bandit is never made aware of Frog's leaving Junior at the altar, which is why the Bandit continually asks why a Texas sheriff is chasing him. The film's editors, Walter Hannemann and Angelo Ross, were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\nAlfred Hitchcock claimed that the film was one of his favorites. Upon meeting Reynolds, Billy Bob Thornton told him that Americans from the region where the film is set consider the film to be less cinema and more documentary. Smokey and the Bandit was released in the United Kingdom on August 28 and was a success there, garnering positive reviews.\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs – Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains:\nBandit (Bo Darville) – Nominated Hero\n\nCultural impact\nPontiac Trans Am\nAfter the debut of the film, the Pontiac Trans Am became wildly popular, with sales almost doubling within two years of the film's release. It outsold its Chevrolet Camaro counterpart for the first time. Reynolds was given the 1977 vehicle used during promotion of the film as a gift, though the car itself never actually appeared in the film. Because of the popularity of the film and the sales success of the Trans Am, the president of Pontiac Alex Mair promised to supply Reynolds with a Trans Am each year. Due to his financial difficulties in 2014, Reynolds put his vast collection of artwork and memorabilia up for auction, including the Trans Am. High estimates for the car were up to $80,000, but the actual sale price was $450,000. Also up for auction was a go-kart replica of the car, which sold for nearly $14,000. In 2015 a Florida-based automobile customization company built 77 Trans Ams modeled after the car that Reynolds drove in the film. These new models were built off the same Camaro platform, came with the Pontiac arrowhead, flaming bird, and Bandit logos, and the instrument panels, center consoles, and hood scoops emulating their 1977 counterparts, and were signed by Reynolds. Some differences included the use of a supercharged 454-CID (7.4-liter) Chevrolet-sourced engine that put out 840 HP, and four round headlights, which appeared on the 1967–69 Firebirds/Trans Ams only; the actual 1977–81 models had rectangular headlights.\n\nDiablo sandwich\nThe \"diablo sandwich\" ordered by Sheriff Justice in the Arkansas barbecue restaurant scene has entered popular culture as a minor reference to the film. Though no authoritative source identifies the composition of the sandwich, there are several possibilities. A segment of the CMT program Reel Eats used a sloppy joe-style recipe consisting of seasoned ground beef, corn, and sour cream. Another proposal, based more closely on images from the film and the shooting location of the scene (at an Old Hickory House restaurant in Georgia), is pulled pork and hot sauce on a hamburger bun. Other sources in East Texas (from whence Sheriff Justice hails) are familiar with the popular regional delicacy known as the Diablo Sandwich. It consists of any of the various Louisiana-style hot sauces on Texas toast-style bread alongside the fourth most famous product of Pittsburg, Texas (behind Pilgrim's Pride, Cavender's, and Carroll Shelby)—Pittsburg Hot Links.\n\nThe Bandit Run\nThe first run in 2007 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the movie, The Bandit Run was the brainchild of Dave Hall, owner of Restore A Muscle Car. A group of Trans Am owners and fans of the movie take part in an annual road trip from Texarkana to Jonesboro, recreating the route taken by the characters in the film. The Bandit Run quickly became a fixture, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the movie with a special 2017 screening of the film attended by Reynolds and a recreation of the jump undertaken by the Bandit and Frog across a river.\n\nMobil 1 commercial\nIn 2014, petroleum company Mobil 1 produced television commercials, featuring then-NASCAR driver Tony Stewart, closely based on the film. Called Smoke is the Bandit and playing on Stewart's nickname, the commercials featured him as the Bandit opposite commentators Darrell Waltrip as the Snowman and Jeff Hammond as Buford T. Justice. The story replaced the Coors beer with Mobil 1 products. The advertisements lampoon the film and feature a Pontiac Trans Am and a cover version of the song East Bound and Down. The commercials were produced after Stewart mentioned that the movie was one of his favorites.\n\nTelevision censorship and alternative versions\nWhen Smokey and the Bandit first aired on American network television in the early 1980s, censors were faced with the challenge of toning down the raw language of the original film. For this purpose, they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive, which was common practice. The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford's often-spoken phrase \"sumbitch\" (a contraction of \"son of a bitch\"; usually in reference to the Bandit) with the phrase \"scum bum\". This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children and the 2007 Hot Wheels release of the 1970s Firebird Trans Am has \"scum bum\" emblazoned on its tail.\nExcept for Gleason, the original actors mostly redubbed their lines for the television version. Actor Henry Corden, who voiced Fred Flintstone after original performer Alan Reed died the same year the film was released, was used to replace a considerable amount of Sheriff Justice's dialogue. In the U.K., the heavily dubbed version was shown for several years, particularly by the BBC. However, in more recent years, the original version has been shown (on ITV, a commercial channel), usually with the stronger language edited out, often quite awkwardly. The theatrical release has a few lines deleted, including an edit in which Sheriff Justice tells a state trooper to \"fuck off\" after the sheriff called his vehicle \"a piece of crap\". His expletive is obscured when a passing big rig sounds its horn. At the time, using \"fuck\" would immediately require an R rating and this self-censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience. However, the scene and the obscured expletive were played for comedy value and written as such, with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors.\nIn 2006, a DVD re-release was issued of Smokey and the Bandit featuring a digitally remastered audio track with 5.1 Dolby-compatible surround sound. Many of the film's original sounds were replaced. For instance, the diesel engine start and run-up sequence in the opening sequence of the film were completely dubbed over with a new sound. A few other examples of sound effect replacement occur when the Bandit takes off after getting the reluctant Cletus involved in the bet, the Bandit comes to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie, and when Buford's car top comes off. Some of the original sound effects (such as Cletus's dog Fred barking) and music (such as the final chase to the Southern Classic) were removed and not replaced. Earlier DVD releases and the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray of the film have the original soundtrack intact. Major portions of the audio background have been modified with different engine sounds or tire squeals from the original film. The updated version of the film features sound inaccurate for what would be produced by the Trans Am or the numerous other Pontiac vehicles in the film. The original film had correct sounds that were usually recorded live as the action took place.\n\nSequels\nThe film was followed by two sequels: Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983). The second film was a modest box office success, earning $66.1 million against a $17 million budget.\nThe third film – which had no involvement from either Hal Needham or Sally Field and contained only a short cameo appearance by Burt Reynolds – revolved entirely around Jackie Gleason's character, was panned by critics, and was a box office bomb, earning only $7 million against a $9 million budget.\n\nTelevision spin-off films\nA series of four made-for-TV spin-off films (Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit, and Bandit's Silver Angel) were produced in 1994 for Universal Television's Action Pack with actor Brian Bloom playing a younger version of the Bandit. The three original films introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am and the Dodge Stealth in the television movies.\n\nTelevision series\nIn October 2020, a Smokey and the Bandit TV series was revealed to be in development, with a pilot written by David Gordon Green and Brian Sides and also executive produced with his Rough House confederates Jody Hill, Danny McBride and Brandon James, as well as Seth MacFarlane and Erica Huggins of Fuzzy Door.\n\nSee also\nThe Cannonball Run\nHooper\nPassage 5:\nSmokey and the Bandit II\nSmokey and the Bandit II is a 1980 American action comedy film directed by Hal Needham, and starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jerry Reed, Jackie Gleason and Dom DeLuise. The film is the sequel to the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit.\nThe film was originally released in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and several other, mainly Commonwealth, countries as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again.\nThe plot centers on Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Jerry Reed), transporting an elephant to the GOP National Convention, with Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) once again in hot pursuit.\n\nPlot\nBig Enos Burdette is in a literal mudslinging campaign against John Conn for Governor of Texas. After failing to get the outgoing governor's endorsement, Big Enos overhears him on the phone ordering a crate in Miami to be delivered in nine days to the Republican National Convention in Dallas. Burdette schemes to earn the governor's endorsement and have the crate delivered to the convention in his name and tracks down Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow and offers him and Bo \"Bandit\" Darville $200,000 to do the run. Cledus takes the Burdettes to Bandit to make the offer in person, but Bandit has become a heavy drinker since breaking up with Carrie (\"Frog\") and is drunk when the Burdettes arrive and double the payoff to $400,000. Cledus accepts on Bandit's behalf, but adds that Big Enos should give them half in advance, to which they agree. Cledus is ecstatic, but Bandit begins to miss Carrie.\nCledus calls Carrie, who is back in Texarkana and again about to marry Junior when Cledus calls offering her $50,000 to help out; she agrees and again becomes a runaway bride. Though she still has feelings for Bandit, when Carrie arrives, she initially intones she is only in it for the money, and she and Cledus work on getting Bandit off the booze and back into shape. She then trades in Junior's car for a new Trans Am. The group arrive at the pier in Miami only to find out the manifest is quarantined for three weeks. They return later that night to steal it, only to find the \"package\" is a live elephant (the G.O.P. mascot) which Cledus names \"Charlotte\" after his aunt. When Bandit removes a splinter from Charlotte's foot, she takes a liking to him.\nSoon after the trio start off for Dallas, they are accosted for the first of several times by Sheriff Justice, but Bandit outwits him and they escape. En route, they stop at a remote fuel station and notice something wrong with Charlotte. Moments later, an ambulance pulls in with an Italian gynecologist in the back; \"Doc\" is initially reluctant to help, but when his driver speeds off unknowingly leaving him stranded, he asks to hitch a ride with them, agreeing to watch Charlotte.\nDoc later finds that Charlotte is pregnant and due to give birth any time, but Bandit is determined to stay on schedule, but Cledus and Frog refuse to they wanted to make Charlotte comfortable. Entering Louisiana, Doc says that Charlotte is almost in labor and needs to be off her feet. Cledus chooses they all need a break and they go to a nearby nightclub where Don Williams is headlining.  When Carrie sees Bandit scribbling on a napkin a picture of Charlotte cradled by suspended netting to keep her off her feet, she angrily leaves, but not before telling Bandit that she will come back only when he likes himself again. Later that night, a drunken Bandit makes his drawing a reality, and Doc agrees that his idea will work.\nBuford intends to call for help from his brothers Reggie, a Mountie Sergeant in Quebec, and Gaylord, an effeminate Texas State Patrolman. Later, as Bandit and Cledus enter Texas, Buford lures the Bandit into a trap: a mass of 40 Texas Patrol and Mountie cruisers pursuing him across a desert basin. Bandit orders Cledus to get to Dallas, but he enlists a large convoy of his trucker pals and comes to Bandit's rescue instead, wrecking nearly all of the cruisers in a giant demolition derby while Doc and Charlotte watch from the sidelines. The two escape by crossing a makeshift trailer bridge with Buford and his brothers in pursuit. Two of the trucks pull away, resulting in Gaylord and Reggie's cruisers crashing in the ensuing gap before they can cross, but Buford is still in pursuit, though his cruiser is barely functioning.\nCledus begs Bandit to stop at a safari reserve, where Charlotte finally gives birth to her baby. Bandit is ready to load them both back up in the truck, but Cledus refuses and then knocks Bandit down when he insults him and was fed with Bandit's selfishness. When he sees Charlotte in tears, Bandit finally comes to his senses and apologizes and realises that taking care of Charlotte and caring for others is more important than $400,000.\nBandit later finds Carrie and tells her that he likes himself now, and that he does not want to be without her. He then tells her that he has not yet taken Charlotte to Dallas, but they can still make it. Carrie is overjoyed when she sees Charlotte's baby, and Bandit asks Charlotte's permission for him and Carrie to get hitched, to which Charlotte trumpets her approval; Doc, now riding in the cab with Cledus and Fred, also voices his approval, and they all drive away with Charlotte and her baby in tow in circus carts on their way to Dallas, with Buford still in pursuit, now driving a Greyhound bus.\n\nCast\nBurt Reynolds as Bo \"The Bandit\" Darville\nJackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T.

Football players Joe Klecko and Terry Bradshaw also appear in both films.\nIt is the first film to feature director Hal Needham's \"Blooper Reel Credit Crawl\" at the end, in that a collection of bloopers and outtakes from the film showed on one side of the screen while the closing credits slowly scrolled up the other side. Cannonball Run, also directed by Needham, used this same technique.\nBuford's brothers were both portrayed by Gleason; \"Reggie\" was a Canadian version of \"Reginald Van Gleason III\", a popular character from Gleason's television show.\nThe film was written and produced before it was announced that the 1980 Republican National Convention would be held in Detroit rather than Dallas.\nMany of the movie's scenes take place in northern Palm Beach County, especially at Burt Reynolds' ranch in Jupiter, Florida.\nAlthough the Bandit again sticks to a Pontiac Trans Am, this time a 1980 Turbo model with five color decals unlike 1981's single color decals, the Snowman switches to a 1980 GMC General, silver with blue trim with the same mural on the trailer as in the original film. This \"new rig\" suggests that the pair were successful in the \"double or nothing\" wager offered by the Burdettes at the end of the first film, where they were persuaded to drive from Atlanta to Boston and back in 18 hours to buy clam chowder and bring it to the Burdettes.\nA world-record automobile jump was captured on film during the \"roundup sequence\", when stuntman Gary Davis jumped a 1974 Dodge Monaco over 150 feet. Davis suffered compressed vertebrae as a result of a hard landing.\nThe roundup sequence in the desert shows many new Pontiac Le Mans sedans decorated as police cars being destroyed. The cars were originally ordered by a car rental agency in Phoenix, who refused to accept the delivery when they discovered the cars were not equipped with air conditioning. Pontiac took the cars back and eventually gave them to the producers to be used in the film.\n\nSoundtrack\nSmokey and the Bandit 2: Original Soundtrack was released on vinyl, cassette tape and 8-track tape by MCA Records in 1980.\n\nTrack listing\nReception\nBox office\nSmokey and the Bandit II grossed $10,883,835 in its opening weekend, the second highest ever at the time, behind Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It also set a record for an opening week, with a gross of $18,108,031. It was the eighth-most-popular 1980 film at the United States and Canada box office earning $66,132,626. This box office income inspired a third film.\n\nCritical response\nThe film received almost completely negative reviews from critics who felt that it suffered badly in comparison to the original. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 29% based on reviews from seven critics. Roger Ebert gave it a one out of four stars and stated that there was \"[in 1980] no need for this movie. That's true of most sequels, but it's especially true of Smokey and the Bandit II, which is basically just the original movie done again, not as well ... how can I say it's lazy when it has 50 trucks doing stunts in it? Because it takes a lot less thought to fill up a movie with stunts than to create a comedy that's genuinely funny\".Burt Reynolds later said that he did not enjoy working on the film at all, feeling that it was an unnecessary sequel put together by Universal purely for money-making reasons rather than to try making a good picture.\n\nSequel\nThe film was followed by another sequel three years later, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983), in which Reynolds only made a brief cameo appearance, and Sally Field did not appear.\nPassage 6:\nThe Nun and the Bandit\nThe Nun and the Bandit is an Australian film directed by Paul Cox.\n\nPlot summary\nIn the 1940s, two outlaw brothers kidnap their wealthy 14-year-old second cousin, but things get complicated when her chaperoning nun refuses to abandon her charge.\n\nProduction\nThe film was made with finance from Film Victoria and the FFC. It was shot near Bacchus Marsh, Maldon in Victoria.\n\nRelease\nAccording to Ozmovies: \n\nRoadshow was the nominal domestic distributor but refused to release it. The film went straight to video, though it had a small theatrical release in Canada thanks to Alliance.\nThe film was screened at the short-lived Halls Gap Film Festival in the Grampians on Sunday, 8 November 1992, with Cox present, though it had also had a \"world premiere\" at the Melbourne Film Festival earlier in the year.Cox called the movie \"minimal filmmaking\":\n\nIt's the very first time I read a book that I wanted to film, because I normally don't believe the film has much to do with the novel. I wasn't at the screening at the Melbourne Film Festival but I never want to screen a film at a festival again. That screening actually killed the release. It got bad reviews in a few places, so Roadshow wouldn't even release it. I think that as an Australian bush film, it is a very, very original film, a highly original piece. The forest, the beauty of the land, that's the altar, and the sacrifice is the innocence and youth. You have a sacrifice on an altar. But it gave me enormous satisfaction because the finished film is very nicely tuned, minimal when you look at the way it's crafted... But that's not what the reviewers want, a bush film like this. That's not very Australian, is it?\nPassage 7:\nHal Needham\nHal Brett Needham (March 6, 1931 – October 25, 2013) was an American stuntman, film director, actor, writer, and NASCAR team owner. He is best known for his frequent collaborations with actor Burt Reynolds, usually in films involving fast cars, such as Smokey and the Bandit (1977), Hooper (1978), The Cannonball Run (1981) and Stroker Ace (1983). \nIn his later years, Needham moved out of stunt work, and focused his energy on the world land speed record project. In 2001, Needham received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards, and in 2012, he was awarded a Governors Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nEarly years\nNeedham was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Edith May (née Robinson) and Howard Needham. He was the youngest of three children. Raised in Arkansas and Missouri, Needham served in the United States Army as a paratrooper during the Korean War, worked as a treetopper (an arborist who performs tree topping services),\nand was a billboard model for Viceroy Cigarettes while beginning a career in Hollywood as a motion picture stuntman.\n\nCareer\nNeedham's first break was as the stunt double for actor Richard Boone on the popular TV western Have Gun, Will Travel.  Needham trained under John Wayne's stunt double Chuck Roberson and quickly became one of the top stuntmen of the 1960s on such films as How the West Was Won, The Bridge at Remagen, McLintock!, The War Lord, and Little Big Man. He doubled regularly for Clint Walker and Burt Reynolds. He played a cowboy in an episode of the TV Western Gunsmoke (S8E36 - “The Odyssey of Jubal Tanner”). Needham moved into stunt coordinating and directing second unit action, while designing and introducing air bags and other innovative equipment to the industry. Needham at one time lived in Reynolds' guesthouse for the better part of 12 years.In 1971, he and fellow stuntmen Glenn Wilder and Ronnie Rondell formed Stunts Unlimited. Needham had written a screenplay titled Smokey and the Bandit and his friend Reynolds offered him the chance to direct. The film was a huge hit, and the two followed it with Hooper, Smokey and the Bandit II, The Cannonball Run, and Stroker Ace. Needham also directed the TV pilots Stunts Unlimited (1980) and Stockers (1981), neither of which was picked up as a series. His final theatrical release as director was the 1986 BMX film Rad.\nIn 1977, Gabriel Toys introduced the \"Hal Needham Western Movie Stunt Set\" complete with a cardboard old west saloon movie set, lights and props, a toy movie camera and a spring-launched Hal Needham action figure that would break through a balcony railing, land on breakaway table and chairs and crash through a window. They were only manufactured for a short time and have since become highly collectible.\nNeedham moved out of stunt work, focusing his energy on the World Land Speed Record project that eventually became the Budweiser Rocket, driven by stuntman Stan Barrett. The team failed to set an officially sanctioned World land speed record with the vehicle, and their claims to have broken the sound barrier in 1979 have been heavily disputed. In the 1980s, he and Reynolds co-owned the Mach 1 Racing team, which fielded the Skoal Bandit No. 33 car in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series for Harry Gant. In 1986, Needham, alongside William L. Fredrick, was awarded a Scientific and Engineering Award for his efforts in developing the Shotmaker Elite camera car and crane.In 2001, Needham received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards. In 2012, he was awarded a Governors Award by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, where he was introduced by Quentin Tarantino.Needham and his relationship with Reynolds inspired the Cliff Booth/Rick Dalton friendship in Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nRocket car\nNeedham was the owner of the Budweiser Rocket car, a vehicle intended to break the speed of sound on land.\n\nDeath\nNeedham died on October 25, 2013 in Los Angeles, California, aged 82, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nBibliography\nNeedham, Hal (2011).

Ferreyra was born on 28 August 1889 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was a director and writer also known for Bewitching Kisses (1937) and La vuelta al Bulín (1926). Ferreyra died on 29 January 1943, at age 53. A fragment (34-minutes) of the film is currently available on YouTube. The restored version will be presented in the San Isidro Film and Music Festival on 15 November. 2016. The nitrate copy of the film was provided by the Fundación Cinemateca Argentina and the restoration work was done by GOTIKA,\n\nSynopsis\nPerdón, viejita (which means \"Sorry, Old Woman\" in English) revolves around a lower-class family: Doña Camila, the aging mother, and Elena and Carlos, her children. Carlos is, unbeknownst to her, a reformed thief. One day he meets Nora, a prostitute, in the park, and decides to bring her home after falling in love with her. Elena, who is being courted by a shady Don Juan, is given a ring as a gift, but Nora takes it away from her complaining that she knows men like Don Juan and the ring is probably stolen. This is evidenced when the police arrive in search for the ring, and Nora takes the fall for Elena.\nPrudencio, Elena's other pretender, takes an interest in Don Juan and after following him forces him to accompany him to the police and confess about the stolen ring. Don Juan is then imprisoned and Nora let go, but she feels her honor has been tainted and her meddling has caused trouble to the family, so she leaves and goes back to her job under the wing of El Gavilán (\"The Hawker\"). Carlos follows suit, and confronts El Gavilán, who in the confrontation wounds Nora from gunshot.\nIn the epilogue, Nora recovers in bed, nursed by Carlos and Prudencio. Elena, who had confessed to accepting the ring from Don Juan to her mother, comes visit with Doña Camila, who apologizes for her mistrust and scorn of Nora. The family reconciles, and live happily ever after.\nPassage 9:\nJosé A. Ferreyra\nJosé A(gustín) Ferreyra (28 August 1889 – 29 January 1943), popularly known as \"Negro Ferreyra\" (Black Ferreyra, due to his partially African ancestry), was an early Argentine film director, screenwriter and film producer. He was also sometimes credited as production designer.\nFerreyra was born in Vicente López, Gran Buenos Aires. His father was of White European descent, while his mother was Afro-Argentine, likely descended from slaves.He began simultaneously directing and screenwriting for film in 1915, and moved on to success directing films such as Palomas rubias in 1920. His films tended to focus on lower-class family drama, most notably Perdón, viejita (1927), and were filmed on a low budget and with little to no script as a guide. Ferreyra prevailes through the 1920s and 1930s as a distinguished filmmaker of the masses, but was displaced in the late 1930s and early 1940s by big budget cinema. He directed over 40 films and wrote the scripts for the majority of them between 1915 and 1941, working with noted actors such as Libertad Lamarque and Mario Soffici on his screen debut, before moving on to directing.\nHe died on 29 January 1943 from laryngeal cancer.\n\nFilmography\nChimbela (1939)\nLa Ley que olvidaron (1938)\nBesos Brujos (1937)\nAyúdame a Vivir (1936)\nPuente Alsina (1935)\nStreets of Buenos Aires (1934)\nEl Cantar de mi ciudad (1930)\nPerdón, viejita (1927)\nMuchachita de Chiclana (1926)\nLa costurerita que dio aquel mal paso (1926)\nLa vuelta al Bulín (1926)\nMi último tango (1925)\nEl organito de la tarde (1925)\nEl arriero de Yacanto (1924)\nMientras Buenos Aires duerme (1924)\nOdio serrano (1924)\nLa Leyenda del puente inca (1923)\nMelenita de oro (1923)\nCorazón de criolla (1923)\nLa Maleva (1923)\nLa Chica de la calle Florida (1922)\nLa Muchacha del arrabal (1922)\nBuenos Aires, ciudad de ensueño (1922)\nLa Gaucha (1921)\nPalomas rubias (1920)\nDe vuelta al pago (1919)\nCampo ajuera (1919)\nEl tango de la muerte (1917)\nVenganza gaucha (1917)\nLa fuga de Raquel (1916)\nLa isla misteriosa (1916)\nUna noche de garufa (1915)\nPassage 10:\nThe Bandit Trail\nThe Bandit Trail is a 1941 Western film.\n\nPlot\nA cowboy helps rob a bank to get revenge on an unscrupulous banker.\n\nCast\nTim Holt as Steve Haggerty\nRay Whitley as Smokey\nJanet Waldo\tas Ellen Grant\nLee 'Lasses' White as Whopper\nMorris Ankrum as Red Haggerty\nRoy Barcroft as Joel Nesbitt\nGlenn Strange as Gang member", "answers": ["Perdón, Viejita"], "length": 10456, "dataset": "2wikimqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d7f6203bfe33e28a517ed4214f515fb80671c48edd4720a6"}
