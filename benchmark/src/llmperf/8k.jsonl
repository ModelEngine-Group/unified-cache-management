{"input": "Why is it important for the sides of the fuselage to be sloped (tumbled home)?", "context": "Probably one of the most frustrating things about building experimental aircraft, especially when starting with a minimum of pre-fabricated parts, is to start building and ending up with an unexpected result. Every builder starts a new project by wanting it to go \"perfectly.\" So when things aren't going well, especially at the beginning, the frustration can lead to an unfinished airplane.\nThis is the first article in a series dedicated to helping builders of the Rand Robinson KR series planes build a straight and true fuselage -- the first part of the construction process. Borrowing from modern boatbuliding techniques, focus will be on the KR-2S, but the principles apply to the entire lineup of KR-1 & KR-2 series planes.\nWhile building the KR-2(s) a common surprise is encountered by builders when the completed fuselage sides are laid into position to form the fuselage box section. With many hours spent building the sides flat, finding the once straight longerons that now bow up from the building surface, form a most dissatisfying \"banana\" shape. Especially when using the preformed fiberglass parts, this curve in the top longeron is not acceptable. The builder is left wondering what went wrong and no amount of clamping or brute force forming will solve the problem to any degree of satisfaction. The problem is not the builder's fault. The solution starts by understanding the three dimensional relationship of the assembled parts being built.\nFirst understand that the plans show the finished form of the plane. They show the \"projected\" form as you would expect to see it if viewing an actual plane from the top, ends and from the side. Since the sides are sloped (flared) outward, looking from the side, the distances given by measuring the profile drawing are \"foreshortened\" and don't give the proper shape for building the fuselage with a flat top longeron. What needs to be done is to \"develop\" the \"true\" distances and shape of the flat panel so that when it is curved into position, the longerons lay flat.\nSecond, understand that the dimensions called for in the plans put a twist in the sides that tends to work the panel in two directions of curvature. This twist makes the panel \"undevelopable\" meaning that that shape cannot be unrolled into an equivalent flat shape. This is important when laying out the side and bottom panels onto flat plywood. To illustrate this, try forming a piece of paper around a soda can. The paper can be formed flat around the can either straight or at a diagonal to it's length. It has only one direction of curvature and is by definition \"developable\". Now try to form the same piece of paper around a baseball. It won't lie flat on the surface without some deformation (folding, wrinkling or tearing) of the paper. The ball has curvature in more that one direction and is a \"compounded\" shape. Paper (or plywood) can only be readily formed in developable shapes as opposed to aluminum or other metal which can accept in plane deformation. A developable surface is needed to lay out a curved surface when the materials used can't be deformed with any degree of in-plane strain.\nInitially, the fuselage sides are laid out flat with reference to the top longeron measured to a straight chalk line. The bowing problem starts when the side panels are bent and sloped to form the fuselage box section. If the sides were not sloped (tumbled home), the section formed would be cylindrical and the longerons would lie flat. Since the sides are tumbled home, the section formed is now conical. When a conical shape is cut with a plane (building surface) not perpendicular to it's axis, the shape formed is elliptical -- exactly what happens with the top longeron. When it's built flat, bent to form a cylindrical section, and sloped to form a conical section, it takes on an elliptical shape firewall to tailstock.\nThis method borrows heavily from proven techniques used in the marine trades. It should be stressed at this point that although the layout procedure is not complicated, it is important to take your time. If the layout is not going well initially, start over! Better to erase layout errors now than to have them built it and cause surprises later.\nLayout to ensure a fair and true fuselage starts by drawing a reference line (baseline) on the building surface. Refer to figures 2 & 3 and use a wire guide to draw a very straight baseline. About 500 lbs. Of tension should be adequate. One could use a chalk line, but we're talking airplanes here, not house framing.\nThe main layout difference is that the baseline isn't used as a reference for the top longeron. The baseline references the mid point of the firewall for the developed (and true dimensioned) side panel. Although the baseline will still be the reference, the top and bottom longerons will be laid separately.\nLayout differences don't end there. Each of the stations (vertical members) will be laid out with a calculated separation so that when the panels are formed into position, they land on the spacing called for in the plans. Another major difference is that the bottom & side panels are applied after forming the fuselage box section. This is mainly to obtain the ability to \"fair\" the side and bottom surfaces and insure a straight and true shape.\nRefer to figure 1 for the layout of the new developed side panel. The firewall (station a) is layed out perpendicular to the baseline. Longitudinal (station) measurements are given along the length of the baseline from the firewall. Vertical dimensions are given to reference the angle and breadths of the station at the baseline.\nNotice that the top longeron is bowed outward and that the stations are spaced slightly greater than called out in the plans. When the panels are formed into the box frame section ,they will work into the dimensions specified in the plans.\nStrike a centerline, longer than is needed on the building surface using a wire guide. Draw off the firewall line perpendicular to the centerline at one end.\nUsing the distances listed in the balloons, mark them off on the centerline. Distances are measured to the nearest sixteenth of an inch. Take time to mark them off carefully. Don't mark off the distances in a cumulative fashion. Use the firewall as a common reference.\nUsing the angles listed at each station, mark off a station line longer than is needed. The angles are measured to the nearest hundredth of a degree. Take time to mark them off carefully.\nAt each station, start by marking off each short (bottom longeron) line distance from the centerline. Use your set of trammels or beam compass for doing this. Mark the intersection of the short line with the station line.\nAt each station, mark off each long (top longeron) line distance from the intersection of the short line distance and the station line. Again the trammels or beam compass is best for completing this step. Mark the intersection of the long line distance with the station line.\nUsing the longeron as a batten, trace out the inside and outside curves of the longeron. After the batten is secure, in between each station, fasten a keeper block inside and outside to preserve the shape of the longeron taking care to avoid potential future interference with the diagonal members to be installed later. The fairing blocks can be removed or left in place if they won't interfere with building. The vertical station members and their diagonals can now be measured and positioned. Remember to refer to the plans for the material thickness direction.\nAfter vertical and diagonal members are cut and fitted, take time to draw their outlines on the building surface to cut down on time and confusion when laying out the opposite side.\nFinishing the side panel is accomplished in a manner similar to that called for in the handbook with the exception that the side and bottom skin panels will be attached later.\nThe next article in the series will discuss jigging and building techniques to ensure alignment and straightness of the flat built side panels. Also covered will be building a \"strongback\" jig to assure alignment of the side panels when they are formed into their final shape.\nPart 3 in the series will cover assembly of the side panels using the jigs. Some joint details will be discussed that will ensure a stronger and more fair fuselage assembly. Also covered will be the layout & attachment of the side and bottom ply skins.\nU.S. Mail: Densmore Associates, inc.\nANSI \"D\" size, computer generated plots of all the layout drawings in this series are available from the author for $30 plus postage & handling. Full (true size) scale plots may be made available depending on demand.\n\"Scarfing\" is the practice of splicing plywood so that short pieces of plywood can be used to span long distances. On the KR, it is required on both the fuselage skins and spar webs. The angle of the splice should be 10 to 12 degrees to maintain strength across the joint. Also, joints should coincide with structural members, such as spar webs or fuselage truss members.\nThis scarfer is made by mating a regular plunge router (this one costs about $50) to a table saw. Obviously, you really only need a table saw to cut the chamfer, but it does make a nice heavy table for scarfing. You could just as easily use a large work table as the base.First, set the table saw for a 5.5 degree cut (for a 1:12 joint, or 6.5 degree cut for a 10:1 joint), and run a 1 x 6 through on edge to chamfer a corner on the board. Then drill the board for three router mounting holes (two are countersunk) and connect the assembly to the table saw with two 1/4 inch bolts. Use a long (2-3 inch) straight cutting bit to do the cutting. Adjust the bit so it doesn't interfere with your table top, and go to town. Keep pressure on the plywood to ensure contact with the table while you're scarfing. Make sure you feed your material from the same end as you would if you were sawing, or the router will take your plywood away from you and put a big dent in your garage door.\nIn the late 60's Ken Rand and Stuart Robinson were working as flight system engineers for Douglas Avionics. Ken was working as an electrical engineer, having previously worked for Sperry as an autopilots project engineer, while Stu's degree was in aeronautical engineering from Northrop University. They were two of the guys at the end of the DC-8,9, and 10 assembly lines responsible for correcting some of the nits and picks in various systems before delivery to the customer.\nThey both wanted to build a fast, inexpensive airplane which was also economical to maintain. Several designs were considered, and plans were bought first for the Jeanie's Teenie and then the Taylor Monoplane. The Monoplane was more to their liking, but would require some modification to fit their needs. A cooperative redesign effort ensued, with virtually no dimensions left untouched. Only the basic fuselage structure, airfoil, and powerplant were retained. The tail shape was Stu's, and came directly from the big DC-8s parked on the ramp outside his office window. The landing gear was designed by Ken, after seeing the gear on a Dewey Bird at Santa Paula airport.\nKen was killed in his KR2 a short time later while flying over Cajon Pass in what was apparently a bad weather / low fuel accident. Ken's wife Jeanette became owner of RR overnight, and stepped up to keep the plans and parts coming. Much of the engineering needs are handled by Bill Marcy of Denver, who's been helping out since early '79.\nTo date, almost 6000 KR1, 9200 KR2, and 760 KR2S plan sets have been sold. 1200 KR2s are estimated to be flying, with 5 KR2Ss now in the air. Much of the development work done on KR's is now done by the builders themselves. KR builders tend to be innovative, which leads to some interesting modifications. Some of the mods that work eventually creep into the plans. The KR2S is a case in point. Many builders who'd heard of the pitch sensitivity and tight cabin of the KR2 began to build an enlarged version, with the length determined by the most commonly available longeron material. The result is a KR2 that is stretched 2\" between firewall and main spar, and 14\" behind the main spar. Higher gross weights dictated more wing area, with the new standard becoming the Diehl wing skin. Those who plan to carry passengers commonly stretch the cabin width a few inches, although 1.5 inches is the limit if you still want to use RR's premolded parts.\nMike Stearns addresses the KR Forum crowd.\nThis year's KR Forum featured guest speakers Mike Stearns, Steve Trentman, and Bill Marcey. Mike Stearns spoke on several topics, including the many sources for KR and homebuilding information available on the Internet. He also mentioned KRNet, the list server devoted entirely to KR aircraft, as well as several notable World Wide Web home pages. He also brought a sample of the new Rand Robinson wing skins with him, and discussed their high temperature core prepreg construction. His KR2S will receive the first set, which is currently being installed at Hinson Composites.\nSteve Trentman spoke on his turbine installation. It uses a turbine engine which saw duty as an A7 attack jet starter engine. Total weight is about 85 pounds, while putting out around 90 horsepower. There is a small stockpile of these engines available from government surplus. sources. This engine can only be throttled back to 52% power, which leads to some pretty interesting landings. One inflight failure has been logged so far, with very little damage to the aircraft. More on this exciting development in next month's issue of KROnline.\nLes Palmer's KR2 N202LP won Best KR2, Best Engine Installation, and People's Choice awards at the 1995 KR Gathering at Columbia, TN. After researching the KR series, and reading Neil Bingham's \"A Critical Analysis of the KR2\" (Jan 88 Sport Aviation), Les decided to build his as a single seater, stretched 24\" in the tail, while maintaining a stock width firewall. His fuselage is made from Douglas fir, which weighs in at 4 lbs heavier than if constructed from spruce. It is skinned with 1/8\" birch plywood. Spars are covered with plywoood on both fore and aft sides, ala KR2S. Diehl wing skins provide the lift. Horizontal stabilizer and elevator were stretched 7\" longer on each side, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were stretched 8\" taller. . The fuselage to cowling junction was made more graceful by adding 1.5 inches to the height of the firewall end of the fuselage sides.\nLes's canopy is a Dragonfly, using a four linkage system to swing forward when opening. The canopy frame fits snugly into a recess in the foward deck, providing an excellent wind and water seal. The fiberglass work is exemplary.\nSeating is luxurious for one.\nThe cowling is also a work of art, and uses NACA ducts for efficiency. Female molds were made for all the fiberglass parts on Les's plane, so he could proabably be persuaded to make more, if demand dictates. Les also machines a multitude of KR aluminum and steel parts which he now offers for sale.\nThe firewall was reinforced with aluminum brackets and angles bolted between the longerons in anticipation of the 200 lb Subaru EA-81 engine installation. His 100 HP Asian version is outfitted with an American Holley 5200 caburetor and manifold. It uses a PSRU of Les's own design, featuring two spur gears with a 1.69:1 reduction ratio and a toothed belt. Other than tapping the crank for larger bolts to mount the redrive, no other engine modifications were required. Also, this is probably the only air conditioned KR2 on the planet. The prop is a 60/63 Hegy.\nOriginally built as a taildragger, the fixed gear is made from 4130 steel tubing. Custom cast 6.00x6 aluminum wheels and steel rotors are mated with 6\" Cleveland calipers for braking. An early taxi test accident damaged the main gear, and prompted Les to change to tricycle gear. Again, he designed his own fiberglass main gear, and uses a Diehl nose wheel fork with a 4130 strut and 6\" wheel up front.\nEarly tests revealed cooling problems, which prompted a radiator move from the firewall to a lower cowling location.\nThe first flight was almost a disaster, as test pilot Randy Smith lost power right after takeoff. He managed a 180 with a safe downwind landing with only minor nosewheel pant damage. The culprit proved to be a spark plug with too much reach, which was quickly remedied. Subsequent flights have shown water temp to be about 210 degrees, oil temp is 220-230, and airspeed is about 180 mph.\nShopping for the Partially Built KR.\nThis story starts about twenty years ago when I first started looking at the KR-2 as the plane I'd like to build. The only problem at that time was a lack of money, lack of knowledge, and a lack of job stability. I liked the design, except for the low ground clearance of the retractable gear and that a KR was going to be a tight fit for me to fly.\nOver the past twenty years I've owned a number of planes, but still always wanted to build my own. I needed one that would fit me, my budget requirements, and have the speed and performance that I wanted. When \"KITPLANES\" published the article featuring Roy Marsh's new KR-2S, it was the first I had heard of any major modifications or improvements to the same old KR design. I believe that article and Roy Marsh's workmanship have probably been the greatest boon to Rand Robinson (RR) in the last twenty years. It certainly caught my eye! Here was the same design I had decided I wanted to build twenty years ago, with all of the improvements I wanted. It was sitting on fixed gear with some reasonable ground clearance. It had the capability to be built large enough to accommodate me. It has enough prefab parts available that it didn't have to be 100% scratch built if I decided to hurry the project along. And it had the speed I wanted. I knew that Roy's published speeds were probably not realistic expectations for the average KR, but after knocking around for the last three years in my Champ, anything over 90 mph seems pretty fast to me.\nAfter purchasing the info kit and the sales video from Rand Robinson, the next step after deciding for sure to build this plane was to order the KR-2 plans and the KR-2S addendum. I finally got my plans and was putting together my first order to start the plane, when my partner in the Champ pointed out that there was a partially completed KR-2S for sale in Trade-a-plane. My initial answer was \"No, I don't even want to look at it. I want to build my own from scratch.\" My partner insisted that for the advertised price and the fact that it wasn't too far away, I ought to at least give the guy a call and investigate it. \"No, I don't think I want to buy someone else's problems,\" I persisted. That night I went home and crunched up some numbers on the calculator and finally came to the conclusion that for the sake of my budget for the next several years, I really should give this guy a call.\nThree days later, I flew to his place about 400 miles away to take a look at his project. At this point I should probably mention that I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about airplane construction, although the vast majority of my experience is with tube and fabric. The rest of this article deals with what I looked for and more importantly what I missed and have had to repair in the last year since I purchased the project.\nWhen we went to the seller's house, I found that the left wing was built using the Dan Diehl wing skins and the right wing skins were leaning against the wall inside the house. Also the canopy was in the house with the canopy covered with paper and tape. I wanted to inspect the fuselage first, so off we went to the shop.\nThere I found a fuselage sitting on it's gear painted in primer gray. The first step was to inspect the quality of workmanship of what could be seen as it sat. The interior of the fuselage looked as if it had been built with a great deal of care. The fit and finish of all of the interior wood was very nice. Even the gussets looked like they had been painstakingly perfectly fitted. The glass work on the turtle back also looked very precise and clean. It was evenly faired into the vertical and horizontal stabs. The tail also appeared to be well built with the exception of a depression directly over the front and rear spars in the horizontal stabs. He explained that when he moved recently, that he had shot the plane with gray primer to protect it from the weather since he wouldn't have ready access to a shop to put it in right away. It ended up sitting out in the hot south Texas summer sun for a few weeks before he got a shop rented to work in. That caused the glass (or possibly the foam inside the horizontal stab) to swell, except that it held onto the spar, so it was slightly ballooned in front of and behind the spars. His recommendation was to fill it back smooth with micro.\nI also found a small linear crack in the lower left wing spar cap on the left wing stub. It appeared to be from over tightening the rear spar wing attach fitting bolts. His explanation was that the crack wasn't important because the rear spars only job is to keep the wings from folding back. I also noticed that the holes for attaching the outer wing to the wing stub were badly rounded out on the rear spar. He explained that the Diehl wing skins require the rear spar to be swept slightly more forward than the stock wings. This won't allow you to use the rear spar attach fittings from RR and that I would need to fabricate a new set of rear spar attach fittings.\nI also found that the aileron bellcranks were not built or installed as per plans, but found that they looked professional. I couldn't check for function since the right bellcrank and sheeve wasn't installed, the left wing also wasn't installed, and the right wing didn't exist yet.\nNext we pulled the inspection panels off of the fuselage and tail and looked at everything I could see with a good flashlight. I didn't find anything else that might be questionable about the fuselage except for a cracked elevator trim tab that was damaged when it fell off it's hanging place on the wall.\nNext we spent some time going over his builders log and builders photo album. I still hadn't seen anything that would dissuade me from buying this project.\nAt this point it was starting to get late and my ride down needed to get airborne for the flight home. I needed to make a decision about whether I wanted this project or not, but I hadn't inspected the wings and canopy yet. I took a cursory look at the left wing and saw lots on micro built up on it and some bubbles in the leading edge, but nothing that looked seriously wrong to my amateur eye. The right wing was only a set of spars in the shop and the Diehl wing skins in the house, so there wasn't much to look at there. The canopy was wrapped in paper and tape, so there wasn't much to look at there either. I decided that even if there were serious problems in the wing that was built, I would be money ahead to go ahead and buy the project. For the advertised price, I could build a new set of wings and still be way ahead financially. We negotiated a final price, shook hands, took my ride to the airport, and started off in search of a U-haul to haul the project home.\nNow, at this point, some of you are thinking about what I surely must have forgotten to inspect and why didn't I take a local A & P or EAA member along for the ride. First of all, I don't know any mechanics locally that have any experience with glass and our EAA chapter of which I am VP is woefully lacking in fiberglass knowledge. Secondly, as you will see, I missed plenty. Some by ignorance, some by just not looking close enough.\nNow for a list of the problems that I found over the last year and a few of the fixes that I came up with.\nI found that the lower set of rear spar attach fittings on the left rear spar were installed backwards with the longer spaced hole towards the fuselage. Since this is the same place that also had the cracked spar cap, it required a major change. Also in the same area he had drilled through the rear spar with a hole saw to create a place for the aileron cable to pass through and managed to cut out the second from the outside vertical brace in the spar. Then he chose to install the aileron bellcranks in front of the rear spar, and cut another hole through the rear spar for the aileron push rod. He also managed to cut out the outside vertical brace in the spar. Since the holes were already drilled through the spar, the choices were to either cut out that section of spar cap and scarf a new piece in, cut the whole rear spar carrythrough out of the fuselage including ruining the left lower wing skin, or do something else creative to reinforce the spar cap and install a custom built set of attach fittings.\nI also found that after I built and installed the right side wing stub ribs and skin that the aileron bellcrank setup would not work as installed. The cable that crosses between the two bellcranks had a sharp uphill from the sheeve to the bellcrank in the last 12 inches on either side. This combined with the radius that the bellcranks turn caused the cross cable to pull up tight when the ailerons were pushed to either end of their travel, but allowed the cables to go very slack when the ailerons were centered. Also the Aileron pushrods needed to pass directly through the lower set of rear wing attach fittings to attach to the aileron. This whole rear spar and aileron bellcrank setup was going to either have to be redesigned or cut out and built to plans. The bottom line is that the problems I observed when I inspected this part were much more serious than expected when I had to fix it.\nI decided that I had to remove the rear fittings from the left wing to be replaced with the new set that my neighborhood machinist was cutting out for me. When I put the wing on the work bench to start removing the rear fittings, I thought I had better take a closer look at the bubbles in the leading edge. I found that as I pushed on the leading edge, it delaminated between the glass lay-up on top and the upper and lower wing skin edges that were floxed together underneath. I concluded that that area had to come apart and took a belt sander to the leading edge. What I found was that the leading edge had been floxed together and glassed over, but the mold release had never been scrubbed off the leading edge of the wing. It peeled apart for rebuild quite easily.\nWhen I got back to removing the rear spar attach fittings, I noticed that the woodwork inside the wing looked awfully dull. The reason was that the wing had been closed up without varnishing any of the woodwork. This was rectified with a small hole saw, a number of extensions and a modified undercoating sprayer.\nI also found that the aluminum drain fitting in the bottom of the left wing tank had been glassed into place upside down. The tapered pipe threads were tapered the wrong way to install the draincock into the tank. Retapping the fitting the right direction seemed to be a good fix for that problem.\nWhen I finally got around to attaching the wing to the fuselage, I found that the front spar attach fittings were badly misaligned. Although they could be forced into alignment, I didn't think I needed that kind of preload on the main spar fittings. This problem was fixed by calling on my local neighborhood machinist to build me an aligning fixture and reaming the attach holes to the next larger size and ordering the new sized bolts.\nOn the fuselage I found that although it had new Cleveland wheels and brakes on it, one of the brakes had a severe wobble to it. I must complement the manufacturers for taking care of that problem. One call to the Cleveland factory and they shipped me a new set of wheels and brakes even though the receipt for this set was over four years old and in the original builders name. Their only concern was that this set had never been placed in service yet.\nI chose to sand the load of micro off the left wing to see what it was covering. When I got down to the glass, I found that there was no glass for the aft inch and a half of the underside of the wing in front of the aileron hinge. With the Diehl wing skins, you build the wings, then cut the ailerons out of trailing edge of the wing. He had mismeasured and cut too much material off the bottom side of the trailing edge in front of the aileron. It was filled by floxing a piece of spruce into the gap to fill the space between the back edge of the fiberglass and the aileron mount. I chose to wrap the trailing edge of that wing, and the other wing to match with a couple of lay-ups of glass.\nWhen I sanded the primer off the aforementioned damaged trim tab, I found that the hinge was floxed to the leading edge of the foam insides of the tab, but not the glass. I also chose to wrap the front of the trim tab with a lay-up of glass.\nI decided to pull the paper off the canopy and take a look at it before I'm ready to bolt it on and fly. The original builder had blown his own canopy and after some of the previous problems, I was beginning to have some concerns about not having looked it over closely enough. The canopy turned out to have been blow a little too large. It ended up with a little larger bubble for headroom, which I didn't object to. However, it had more headroom on the right side than the left. Yes, it was just a little bit lopsided. The main problem was that the canopy is stretched thin enough that it can be easily pushed in with one hand when the weather is warm.. My fear was that this is just thin enough that it may decide to lay on my head or in my lap when flying on a warm day. It will have to be replaced.\nI'm sure that many that are reading this could see several of the potential problems before I mentioned them, but some others may not have and I'm sure that there could have been many other problems that didn't but could have existed on this project. This is also not intended to be critical of the gentleman that started this project as many parts of it, especially the wood work are better than I could have done and much of his work is outstanding. I prefer to think that I'll end up with a better plane with his woodwork combined with my glasswork. This article is intended to feature some of the problems that you may run into in buying someone else's project.\nThe final question is, knowing what I have found over the past year, would I have still purchased this project. The answer is yes, but primarily because the price was right in that I am still money and work ahead of where I would be if I had started the project from scratch. There are a few things that I would have done differently, but nothing that I can't live with. Although I won't be able to say that I built it all from scratch, I have built and rebuild enough of the plane that I should have no problem qualifying under the 51% rule.\nYou can send comments directly to the author via e-mail at \"jscott@LANL.GOV\".\nHere is an brief explanation of how I built my turtledecks. The jig was constructed from scrap plywood and a few 1x4s that I ripped into stringers. I made two temporary bulkheads from the plywood, one for each end. Remember the forward bulkhead needs to be shaped in a way that will closely match the aft end of your canopy frame. Make an aft bulkhead by placing a straight edge at the top of your forward bulkhead and the trailing edge of your horizontal stabilizer. This will give you an idea of how tall your aft bulkhead needs to be. As far as location, I placed my aft bulkhead just forward of the lower/front of my vertical fin. I constructed the jig on the fuselage, it is glued together with automotive bondo.\nAfter the bulkheads were bondoed to the fuselage I used the stringers that I ripped from the 1x4s and bondoed them to the bulkheads. This gave me a male form to cover with thin plastic or posterboard. I stapled two layers of posterboard to the jig(thin plastic would work better). The posterboard wraps down two inches onto the fuselage. After I was satisfied with the way it looked, I then covered the entire thing with duct tape (fiberglass will not stick to duct tape) On top of this I wetout one layer of tri-ply cloth (22oz) that I had left over from an earlier project, and one layer of 8oz. bid. Remember to mask off your fuselage so you don't get epoxy on it. If you are not familiar with composite lay-ups, you should plan on razor cutting your lay-ups 4 to 6 hours after wetout while the lay-up is still soft enough to cut with a razorblade.\nAfter the lay-up cured (2 or 3 days) it was removed from the jig, and the jig was removed from the fuselage and discarded. (be careful, the bondo sticks very well to the spruce, you could splinter your wood during removal) I now have a fiberglass skin that tends to hold the shape of the jig but is still flexible enough to work with. I made two bulkheads out of 1/4 last-a-foam (AS&S) using the plywood formers from the jig as a guide. I covered these foam bulkheads with one 8oz layer of glass on each side, with a glass to glass edge on the bottom. After cure these bulkheads were bondoed into place (to the fuselage)and the fiberglass skin was pulled down tight and floxed to the bulkheads. When the flox cured the bondo joints were broken, again being careful not to harm the wood. The turtledeck was removed from the fuselage and 2 inch tapes added to the bulkheads inside and out.\nAt this point the turtledeck looked great and only weighed about 5lbs. but I noticed you could deform the skin by pushing hard on the outside. So I flipped the turtledeck over and from 1/4 inch last-a-foam, I cut two inch wide strips that would run the entire length, forward and aft inside the turtledeck. In effect these would act as composite stringers, I made enough of these two inch wide strips to make up three stringers. One down the center (sort of a backbone) and one on each side of the \"backbone\" half the distance to the edge of the turtledeck.

Social learning, which uses cues from experts, can greatly benefit from the usage of explicit communication to align heterogeneous policies, reduce sample complexity, and solve partially observable tasks. Emergent communication, a type of explicit communication, studies the creation of an artificial language to encode a high task-utility message directly from data.\nHowever, in most cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).\nWe show that our model is able to i) develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents with minimal bits, ii) develop communication to align the action policies of heterogeneous agents with dissimilar feature models, and iii) learn a communication policy from watching an expert's action policy, which we term 'social shadowing'.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSocial learning agents analyze cues from direct observation of other agents (novice or expert) in the same environment to learn an action policy from others. However, observing expert actions may not be sufficient to coordinate with other agents. Rather, by learning to communicate, agents can better model the intent of other agents, leading to better coordination.\nIn humans, explicit communication for coordination assumes a common communication substrate to convey abstract concepts and beliefs directly , which may not be available for new partners. To align complex beliefs, heterogeneous agents must learn a message policy that translates from one theory of mind to another to synchronize coordination.\nEspecially when there is complex information to process and share, new agent partners need to learn to communicate to work with other agents. Emergent communication studies the creation of artificial language. Often phrased as a Lewis game, speakers and listeners learn a set of tokens to communicate complex observations .\nHowever, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents suffer from partial observability and non-stationarity (due to unaligned value functions) , which aims to be solved with decentralized learning through communication. In the MARL setup, agents, as speakers and listeners, learn a set of tokens to communicate observations, intentions, coordination, or other experiences which help facilitate solving tasks .\nAgents learn to communicate effectively through a backpropagation signal from their task performance . This has been found useful for applications in human-agent teaming , multirobot navigation , and coordination in complex games such as StarCraft II . Communication quality has been shown to have a strong relationship with task performance , leading to a multitude of work attempting to increase the representational capacity by decreasing the convergence rates .\nYet these methods still create degenerate communication protocols , which are uninterpretable due to joined concepts or null (lack of) information, which causes performance degradation. In this work, we investigate the challenges of learning a arXiv:2302.14276v1 LG] 28 Feb 2023 messaging lexicon to prepare emergent communication for social learning (EC4SL) scenarios.\nWe study the following hypotheses: H1) EC4SL will learn faster through structured concepts in messages leading to higher-quality solutions, H2) EC4SL aligns the policies of expert heterogeneous agents, and H3) EC4SL enables social shadowing, where an agent learns a communication policy while only observing an expert agent's action policy.\nBy learning a communication policy, the agent is encouraged to develop a more structured understanding of intent, leading to better coordination. The setting is very realistic among humans and many computer vision and RL frameworks may develop rich feature spaces for a specific solo task, but have not yet interacted with other agents, which may lead to failure without alignment.\nWe enable a compositional emergent communication paradigm, which exhibits clustering and informativeness properties. We show theoretically and through empirical results that compositional language enables independence properties among tokens with respect to referential information. Additionally, when combined with contrastive learning, our method outperforms competing methods that only ground communication on referential information.\nWe show that contrastive learning is an optimal critic for communication, reducing sample complexity for the unsupervised emergent communication objective. In addition to the more human-like format, compositional communication is able to create variable-length messages, meaning that we are not limited to sending insufficiently compressed messages with little information, increasing the quality of each communication.\nIn order to test our hypotheses, we show the utility of our method in multi-agent settings with a focus on teams of agents, high-dimensional pixel data, and expansions to heterogeneous teams of agents of varying skill levels. Social learning requires agents to explore to observe and learn from expert cues.\nWe interpolate between this form of social learning and imitation learning, which learns action policies directly from examples. We introduce a 'social shadowing' learning approach where we use first-person observations, rather than third-person observations, to encourage the novice to learn latently or conceptually how to communicate and develop an understanding of intent for better coordination.\nThe social shadowing episodes are alternated with traditional MARL during training. Contrastive learning, which works best with positive examples, is apt for social shadowing. Originally derived to enable lower complexity emergent lexicons, we find that the contrastive learning objective is apt for agents to develop internal models and relationships of the task through social shadowing.\nThe idea is to enable a shared emergent communication substrate (with minimal bandwidth) to enable future coordi-nation with novel partners. Our contributions are deriving an optimal critic for a communication policy and showing that the information bottleneck helps extend communication to social learning scenarios.\nIn real-world tasks such as autonomous driving or robotics, humans do not necessarily learn from scratch. Rather they explore with conceptually guided information from expert mentors. In particular, having structured emergent messages reduces sample complexity, and contrastive learning can help novice agents learn from experts.\nEmergent communication can also align heterogeneous agents, a social task that has not been previously studied.\n\nMulti-Agent Signaling\n\nImplicit communication conveys information to other agents that is not intentionally communicated . Implicit signaling conveys information to other agents based on one's observable physical position . Implicit signaling may be a form of implicit communication such as through social cues or explicit communication such as encoded into the MDP through \"cheap talk\" .\nUnlike implicit signaling, explicit signaling is a form of positive signaling that seeks to directly influence the behavior of other agents in the hopes that the new information will lead to active listening. Multi-agent emergent communication is a type of explicit signaling which deliberately shares information.\nSymbolic communication, a subset of explicit communication, seeks to send a subset of pre-defined messages. However, these symbols must be defined by an expert and do not scale to particularly complex observations and a large number of agents. Emergent communication aims to directly influence other agents with a learned subset of information, which allows for scalability and interpretability by new agents.\n\nEmergent Communication\n\nSeveral methodologies currently exist to increase the informativeness of emergent communication. With discrete and clustered continuous communication, the number of observed distinct communication tokens is far below the number permissible . As an attempt to increase the emergent \"vocabulary\" and decrease the data required to converge to an informative communication \"language\", work has added a bias loss to emit distinct tokens in different situations .\nMore recent work has found that the sample efficiency can be further improved by grounding communication in observation space with a supervised reconstruction loss . Information-maximizing autoencoders aim to maximize the state reconstruction accuracy for each agent. How-ever, grounding communication in observations has been found to easily satisfy these input-based objectives while still requiring a myriad more samples to explore to find a task-specific communication space .\nThus, it is necessary to use task-specific information to communicate informatively. This will enable learned compression for task completion rather than pure compression for input recovery. Other work aims to use the information bottleneck to decrease the entropy of messages . In our work, we use contrastive learning to increase representation similarity with future goals, which we show optimally optimizes the Q-function for messages.\n\nNatural Language Inspiration\n\nThe properties of the tokens in emergent communication directly affect their informative ability. As a baseline, continuous communication tokens can represent maximum information but lack human-interpretable properties. Discrete 1-hot (binary vector) tokens allow for a finite vocabulary, but each token contains the same magnitude of information, with equal orthogonal distance to each other token.\nSimilar to word embeddings in natural language, discrete prototypes are an effort to cluster similar information together from continuous vectors . Building on the continuous word embedding properties, VQ-VIB , an information-theoretic observation grounding based on VQ-VAE properties , uses variational properties to provide word embedding properties for continuous emergent tokens.\nLike discrete prototypes, they exhibit a clustering property based on similar information but are more informative. However, each of these message types determines a single token for communication. Tokens are stringed together to create emergent \"sentences\".\n\nPreliminaries\n\nWe formulate our setup as a decentralized, partially observable Markov Decision Process with communication (Dec-POMDP-Comm). Formally, our problem is defined by the tuple, S, A, M, T , R, O, Ω, γ . We define S as the set of states, A i , i ∈ [1, N ] as the set of actions, which includes task-specific actions, and M i as the set of communications for N agents.\nT is the transition between states due to the multi-agent joint action space T : S × A 1 , ..., A N → S. Ω defines the set of observations in our partially observable setting. Partial observability requires communication to complete the tasks successfully. O i : M 1 , ..., M N × Ŝ → Ω maps the communications and local state, Ŝ, to a distribution of observations for each agent.\nR defines the reward function and γ defines the discount factor.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe policy network is defined by three stages: Observation Encoding, Communication, and Action Decoding. The best observation encoding and action decoding architecture is task-dependent, i.e., using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), CNNs , GRUs , or transformer layers are best suited to different inputs.\nThe encoder transforms observation and any sequence or memory information into an encoding H. The on-policy reinforcement learning training uses RE-INFORCE or a decentralized version of MAPPO as specified by our experiments. Our work focuses on the communication stage, which can be divided into three substages: message encoding, message passing (often considered sparse communication), and message decoding.\nWe use the message passing from . For message decoding, we build on a multiheaded attention framework, which allows an agent to learn which messages are most important . Our compositional communication framework defines the message encoding, as described in section 4.\n\nObjective\n\nMutual information, denoted as I(X; Y ), looks to measure the relationship between random variables, which is often measured through Kullback-Leibler divergence , I(X; Y ) = D KL (p(x, y)||p(x) ⊗ p(y)). The message encoding substage can be defined as an information bottleneck problem, which defines a tradeoff between the complexity of information (compression, I(X, X)) and the preserved relevant information (utility, I( X, Y )).\nThe deep variational information bottleneck defines a trade-off between preserving useful information and compression . We assume that our observation and memory/sequence encoder provides an optimal representation H i suitable for sharing relevant observation and intent/coordination information. We hope to recover a representation Y i , which contains the sufficient desired outputs.\nIn our scenario, the information bottleneck is a trade-off between the complexity of information I(H i ; M i ) (representing the encoded information exactly) and representing the relevant information I(M j =i ; Y i ), which is signaled from our contrastive objective. In our setup, the relevant information flows from other agents through communication, signaling a combination of the information bottleneck and a Lewis game.\nWe additionally promote complexity through our compositional independence objective, This is formulated by the following Lagrangian, where the bounds on mutual information Î are defined in equations 1, 2, and 10. Overall, our objective is,\n\nComplexity through Compositional Communication\n\nWe aim to satisfy the complexity objective, I(H i , M i ), through compositional communication. In order to induce complexity in our communication, we want the messages to be as non-random as possible. That is, informative with respect to the input hidden state h. In addition, we want each token within the message to share as little information as possible with the preceding tokens.\nThus, each additional token adds only informative content. Each token has a fixed length in bits W . The total sequence is limited by a fixed limit, L l W l ≤ S, of S bits and a total of L tokens. We use a variational message generation setup, which maps the encoded hidden state h to a message m; that is, we are modeling the posterior, π i m (m l |h).\nWe limit the vocabulary size to K tokens, e j ∈ R D , j ∈ [1, K] ⊂ N, where each token has dimensionality D and l ∈ [1, L] ⊂ N. Each token m l is sampled from a categorical posterior distribution, 0 otherwise such that the message m l is mapped to the nearest neighbor e j . A set of these tokens makes a message m.\nTo satisfy the complexity objective, we want to use m i to well-represent h i and consist of independently informative m i l .\n\nIndependent Information\n\nWe derive an upper bound for the interaction information between all tokens. Proposition 4.1. For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: The proof is in Appendix A.1. Since we want the mutual information to be minimized in our objective, we minimize,\n\nInput-Oriented Information\n\nIn order to induce complexity in the compositional messages, we additionally want to minimize the mutual information I(H; M ) between the composed message m and the encoded information h. We derive an upper bound on the mutual information that we use as a Lagrangian term to minimize. Proposition 4.2. For the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information, the following upper bound holds:\nThe proof is in Appendix A.1. Thus, we have our Lagrangian term, Conditioning on the input or observation data is a decentralized training objective.\n\nSequence Length\n\nCompositional communication necessitates an adaptive limit on the total length of the sequence. Corollary 4.3. Repeat tokens, w, are redundant and can be removed. Suppose one predicts two arbitrary tokens, w k and w l . Given equation 1, it follows that there is low or near-zero mutual information between w k and w l .\nA trivial issue is that the message generator will predict every available token as to follow the unique token objective. Since the tokens are imbued with input-oriented information (equation 2), the predicted tokens will be based on relevant referential details. Thus, it follows that tokens containing irrelevant information will not be chosen.\nA nice optimization objective that follows from corollary 4.3 is that one can use self-supervised learning with an end-ofsequence (EOS) token to limit the variable total length of compositional message sequences. (3) Algorithm 1 Compositional Message Gen.(h t ) m i ∼ N ( ĥ; µ, σ) 9: end for 10: return m\n\nMessage Generation Architecture\n\nNow, we can define the pipeline for message generation. The idea is to create an architecture that can generate features to enable independent message tokens. We expand each compressed token into the space of the hidden state h (1-layer linear expansion) since each token has a natural embedding in R |h| .\nThen, we perform attention using a softmin to help minimize similarity with previous tokens and sample the new token from a variational distribution. See algorithm 1 for complete details. During execution, we can generate messages directly due to equation 1, resolving any computation time lost from sequential compositional message generation.\n\nUtility through Contrastive Learning\n\nFirst, note that our Markov Network is as follows: H j → M j → Y i ← H i . Continue to denote i as the agent identification and j as the agent ID such that j = i. We aim to satisfy the utility objective of the information bottleneck, I(M j ; Y i ), through contrastive learning as shown in figure 1. Proposition 5.1.\nUtility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, The proof is in Appendix A.1. This result shows a need for gradient information to flow backward across agents along communication edge connections.\n\nExperiments and Results\n\nWe condition on inputs, especially rich information (such as pixel data), and task-specific information. When evaluating an artificial language in MARL, we are interested in referential tasks, in which communication is required to complete the task. With regard to intent-grounded communication, we study ordinal tasks, which require coordination information between agents to complete successfully.\nThus, we consider tasks with a team of agents to foster messaging that communicates coordination information that also includes their observations. To test H1, structuring emergent messages enables lower complexity, we test our methodology and analyze the input-oriented information and utility capabilities.\nNext, we analyze the ability of heterogeneous agents to understand differing communication policies (H2)). Finally, we consider the effect of social shadowing (H3), in which agents solely learn a communication policy from an expert agent's action policy. We additionally analyze the role of offline reinforcement learning for emergent communication in combination with online reinforcement learning to further learn emergent communication alongside an action policy.\nWe evaluate each scenario over 10 seeds.\n\nEnvironments\n\nBlind Traffic Junction We consider a benchmark that requires both referential and ordinal capabilities within a team of agents. The blind traffic junction environment requires multiple agents to navigate a junction without any observation of other agents. Rather, they only observe their own state location.\nTen agents must coordinate to traverse through the lanes without colliding into agents within their lane or in the junction. Our training uses REINFORCE . Pascal VOC Game We further evaluate the complexity of compositional communication with a Pascal VOC . This is a two-agent referential game similar to the Cifar game but requires the prediction of multiple classes.\nDuring each episode, each agent observes a random image from the Pascal VOC dataset containing exactly two unique labels. Each agent must encode information given only the raw pixels from the original image such that the other agent can recognize the two class labels in the original image. An agent receives a reward of 0.25 per correctly chosen class label and will receive a total reward of 1 if both agents guess all labels correctly.\nSee figure 2. Our training uses heterogeneous agents trained with PPO (modified from MAPPO repository). For simplicity of setup, we consider images with exactly two unique labels from a closed subset of size five labels of the original set of labels from the Pascal VOC data. Furthermore, these images must be of size 375 × 500 pixels.\nThus, the resultant dataset comprised 534 unique images from the Pascal VOC dataset.\n\nBaselines\n\nTo evaluate our methodology, we compare our method to the following baselines: (1) no-comm, where agents do not communicate; (2) rl-comm, which uses a baseline communication method learned solely through policy loss ; (3) ae-comm, which uses an autoencoder to ground communication in input observations ; (4) VQ-VIB, which uses a variational autoencoder to ground discrete communication in input observations and a mutual information objective to ensure low entropy communication .\nWe provide an ablation of the loss parameter β in table 1 in the blind traffic junction scenario. When β = 0, we use our compositional message paradigm without our derived loss terms. We find that higher complexity and independence losses increase sample complexity. When β = 1, the model was unable to converge.\nHowever, when there is no regularization loss, the model performs worse (with no guarantees about referential representation). We attribute this to the fact that our independence criteria learns a stronger causal relationship. There are fewer spurious features that may cause an agent to take an incorrect action.\nIn order to understand the effect of the independent concept representation, we analyze the emergent language's capacity for redundancy. A message token m l is redundant if there exists another token m k that represents the same information. With our methodology, the emergent 'language' converges to the exact number of observations and intents required to solve the task.\nWith a soft discrete threshold, the independent information loss naturally converges to a discrete number of tokens in the vocabulary. Our β ablation in table 1 yields a bijection between each token in the vocabulary and the possible emergent concepts, i.e., the enumerated observations and intents. Thus for β = 0.1, there is no redundancy.\nSparse Communication In corollary 4.3, we assume that there is no mutual information between tokens. In practice, the loss may only be near-zero. Our empirical results yield independence loss around 1e − 4. In table 1, the size of the messages is automatically compressed to the smallest size to represent the information.\nDespite a trivially small amount of mutual information between tokens, our compositional method is able to reduce the message size in bits by 2.3x using our derived regularization, for a total of an 8x reduction in message size over non-compositional methods such as ae-comm. Since the base unit for the token is a 32-bit float, we note that each token in the message may be further compressed.\nWe observe that each token uses three significant digits, which may further compress tokens to 10 bits each for a total message length of 20 bits.\n\nCommunication Utility Results\n\nDue to coordination in MARL, grounding communication in referential features is not enough. Finding the communication utility requires grounding messages in ordinal information. Overall, figure shows that our compositional, contrastive method outperforms all methods focused on solely input-oriented communication grounding.\nIn the blind traffic junction, our method yields a higher average task success rate and is able to achieve it with a lower sample complexity. Training with the contrastive update tends to spike to high success but not converge, often many episodes before convergence, which leaves area for training improvement.\nThat is, the contrastive update begins to find aligned latent spaces early in training, but it cannot adapt the methodology quickly enough to converge. The exploratory randomness of most of the early online data prevents exploitation of the high utility f + examples. This leaves further room for improvement for an adaptive contrastive loss term.\nRegularization loss convergence After convergence to high task performance, the autoencoder loss increases in order to represent the coordination information. This follows directly from the information bottleneck, where there exists a tradeoff between utility and complexity. However, communication, especially referential communication, should have an overlap between utility and complexity.\nThus, we should seek to make the complexity loss more convex. Our compositional communication complexity loss does not converge before task performance convergence. While the complexity loss tends to spike in the exploratory phase, the normalized value is very small. Interestingly, the method eventually converges as the complexity loss converges below a normal- ized 0.3.\nAdditionally, the contrastive loss tends to decrease monotonically and converges after the task performance converges, showing a very smooth decrease. The contrastive f − loss decreases during training, which may account for success spikes prior to convergence. The method is able to converge after only a moderate decrease in the f + loss.\nThis implies empirical evidence that the contrastive loss is an optimal critic for messaging. See figure 3.\n\nHeterogeneous Alignment Through Communication\n\nIn order to test the heterogeneous alignment ability of our methodology to learn higher-order concepts from highdimensional data, we analyze the performance on the Pascal VOC game. We compare our methodology against ae-comm to show that concepts should consist of independent information directly from task signal rather than compression to reconstruct inputs.\nThat is, we show an empirical result on pixel data to verify the premise of the information bottleneck. Our methodology significantly outperforms the observation-grounded ae-comm baseline, as demonstrated by figure 4. The ae-comm methodology, despite using autoencoders to learn observation-grounded communication, performs only slightly better than no-comm.\nOn the other hand, our methodology is able to outperform both baselines significantly. It is important to note that based on figure 4, our methodology is able to guess more than two of the four labels correctly across the two agents involved, while the baseline methodologies struggle to guess exactly two of thew four labels consistently.\nThis can be attributed to our framework being able to learn compositional concepts that are much more easily discriminated due to mutual independence.\n\nSocial Shadowing\n\nCritics of emergent communication may point to the increased sample complexity due to the dual communication and action policy learning. In the social shadowing scenario, heterogeneous agents can learn to generate a communication policy without learning the action policy of the watched expert agents. To enable social shadowing, the agent will alternate between a batch of traditional MARL (no expert) and (1st-person) shadowing an expert agent performing the task in its trajectory.\nThe agent only uses the contrastive objective to update its communication policy during shadowing. In figure , the agent that performs social shadowing is able to learn the action policy with almost half the sample complexity required by the online reinforcement learning agent. Our results show that the structured latent space of the emergent communication learns socially benevolent coordination.\nThis tests our hypothesis that by learning communication to understand the actions of other agents, one can enable lower sample complexity coordination. Thus, it mitigates the issues of solely observing actions.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBy using our framework to better understand the intent of others, agents can learn to communicate to align policies and coordinate. Any referential-based setup can be performed with a supervised loss, as indicated by the instant satisfaction of referential objectives. Even in the Pascal VOC game, which appears to be a purely referential objective, our results show that intelligent compression is not the only objective of referential communication.\nThe emergent communication paradigm must enable an easy-to-discriminate space for the game. In multi-agent settings, the harder challenge is to enable coordination through communication. Using contrastive communication as an optimal critic aims to satisfy this, and has shown solid improvements. Since contrastive learning benefits from good examples, this method is even more powerful when there is access to examples from expert agents.\nIn this setting, the communication may be bootstrapped, since our optimal critic has examples with strong signals from the 'social shadowing' episodes. Additionally, we show that the minimization of our independence objective enables tokens that contain minimal overlapping information with other tokens.\nPreventing trivial communication paradigms enables higher performance. Each of these objectives is complementary, so they are not trivially minimized during training, which is a substantial advantage over comparative baselines. Unlike prior work, this enables the benefits of training with reinforcement learning in multi-agent settings.\nIn addition to lower sample complexity, the mutual information regularization yields additional benefits, such as small messages, which enables the compression aspect of sparse communication. From a qualitative point of view, the independent information also yields discrete emergent concepts, which can be further made human-interpretable by a post-hoc analysis .\nThis is a step towards white-box machine learning in multi-agent settings. The interpretability of this learned white-box method could be useful in human-agent teaming as indicated by prior work . The work here will enable further results in decision-making from high-dimensional data with emergent concepts.\nThe social scenarios described are a step towards enabling a zero-shot communication policy. This work will serve as future inspiration for using emergent communication to enable ad-hoc teaming with both agents and humans.\n\nAppendix\n\nA.1. Proofs Proposition 4.1 For the interaction information between all tokens, the following upper bound holds: Proof. Starting with the independent information objective, we want to minimize the interaction information, which defines the conditional mutual information between each token and, Let π i m (m l |h) be a variational approximation of p(m l |h), which is defined by our message encoder network.\nGiven that each token should provide unique information, we assume independence between m l . Thus, it follows that our compositional message is a vector, m = [m 1 , . . . , m L ], and is jointly Gaussian. Moreover, we can define q( m|h) as a variational approximation to p(m|h) = p(m 1 ; . . . , m L |h).\nWe can model q with a network layer and define its loss as || m − m|| 2 . Thus, transforming equation 4 into variational form, we have, it follows that q( m|h) log q( m|h)d m ≥ q( m|h) log Thus, we can bound our interaction information, Proposition 4.2 For the mutual information between the composed message and encoded information, the following upper bound holds:\nProof. By definition of mutual information between the composed messages M and the encoded observations H, we have, Substituting q( m|h) for p( m|h), the same KL Divergence identity, and defining a Gaussian approximation z( m) of the marginal distribution p( m), it follows that, In expectation of equation 1, we have,\nThis implies that, for m = [m 1 , . . . , m L ], there is probabilistic independence between m j , m k , j = k. Thus, expanding, it follows that, where z(m l ) is a standard Gaussian. Proposition 5.1. Utility mutual information is lower bounded by the contrastive NCE-binary objective, Proof. We suppress the reliance on h since this is directly passed through.\nBy definition of mutual information, we have, Our network model learns π R + (y|m) from rolled-out trajectories, R + , using our policy. The prior of our network state, π R − (y), can be modeled from rolling out a random trajectory, R−. Unfortunately, it is intractable to model π R + (y|m) and π R − (y) directly during iterative learning, but we can sample y + ∼ π R + (y|m) and y − ∼ π R − (y) directly from our network during training.\nIt has been shown that log p(y|m) provides a bound on mutual information , with the expectation over l p(m l , y l ). However, we need a tractable understanding of the information Y . In the information bottleneck, Y represents the desired outcome. In our setup, y is coordination information that helps create the desired output, such as any action a − .\nThis implies, y =⇒ a − . Since the transition is known, it follows that a − =⇒ s − f , a random future state. Thus, we have, π This is similar to the proof for lemma A.5, but requires assumptions on messages m from the emergent language. We note that when m is random, the case defaults to lemma A.5. Thus, we assume we have at least input-oriented information in m given sufficiently satisfying equation 2. Given a sufficient emergent language, it follows that y =⇒ a + , where a + is an intention action based on m.\nSimilarly, since the transition is known, a + =⇒ s + f , a desired goal state along the trajectory. Thus, we have, π R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). Recall the following (as shown in ), which we have adapted to our communication objective, Proposition A.3 (rewards → probabilities). The Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function r g (s t , m t ) = (1 − γ)p(s = s g |y t ) is equivalent to the probability of state s g under the discounted state occupancy measure:\nand Lemma A.4. The critic function that optimizes equation 8 is a Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function up to a multiplicative constant 1 The critic function f (s, m, s f ) = y enc(s f ) represents the similarity between the encoding y = enc(s, m) and the encoding of the future rollout s f .\nGiven lemmas A.5 A.6 A.8 and proposition A.7, it follows that equation 8 is the NCE-binary (InfoMAX ) objective, Î(M j , Y i ) = log σ(f (s, m, s + f )) + log 1 − σ(f (s, m, s − f )) which lower bounds the mutual information, I(M j , Y i ) ≥ Î(M j , Y i ). The critic function is unbounded, so we constrain it to [0, 1] with the sigmoid function, σ( * ).\nWe suppress the reliance on h since this is directly passed through. By definition of mutual information, we have, Our network model learns π R + (y|m) from rolled-out trajectories, R + , using our policy. The prior of our network state, π R − (y), can be modeled from rolling out a random trajectory, R−.\nUnfortunately, it is intractable to model π R + (y|m) and π R − (y) directly during iterative learning, but we can sample y + ∼ π R + (y|m) and y − ∼ π R − (y) directly from our network during training. It has been shown that log p(y|m) provides a bound on mutual information , with the expectation over l p(m l , y l ).\nHowever, we need a tractable understanding of the information Y . Lemma A.5. π R − (y) = p(s = s − f |y). In the information bottleneck, Y represents the desired outcome. In our setup, y is coordination information that helps create the desired output, such as any action a − . This implies, y =⇒ a − . Since the transition is known, it follows that a − =⇒ s − f , a random future state.\nThus, we have, π R − (y) = p(s = s − f |y). Lemma A.6. π R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). This is similar to the proof for lemma A.5, but requires assumptions on messages m from the emergent language. We note that when m is random, the case defaults to lemma A.5. Thus, we assume we have at least input-oriented information in m given sufficiently satisfying equation 2. Given a sufficient emergent language, it follows that y =⇒ a + , where a + is an intention action based on m.\nSimilarly, since the transition is known, a + =⇒ s + f , a desired goal state along the trajectory. Thus, we have, π R + (y|m) = p(s = s + f |y, m). Recall the following (as shown in ), which we have adapted to our communication objective, Proposition A.7 (rewards → probabilities). The Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function r g (s t , m t ) = (1 − γ)p(s = s g |y t ) is equivalent to the probability of state s g under the discounted state occupancy measure:\nand Lemma A.8. The critic function that optimizes equation 8 is a Q-function for the goal-conditioned reward function up to a multiplicative constant 1 p(s f ) : exp(f * (s, m, s f ) = 1 p(s f ) Q π s f (s, m). The critic function f (s, m, s f ) = y enc(s f ) represents the similarity between the encoding y = enc(s, m) and the encoding of the future rollout s f .\nGiven lemmas A.5 A.6 A.8 and proposition A.7, it follows that equation 8 is the NCE-binary (InfoMAX ) objective, which lower bounds the mutual information, I(M j , Y i ) ≥ Î(M j , Y i ). The critic function is unbounded, so we constrain it to [0, 1] with the sigmoid function, σ( * ).", "answers": ["An unsupervised method based on the information bottleneck and contrastive learning."], "length": 6235, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "120cb783c796fbedbc76f04cf9be3318e54a63cd642c4401"}
{"input": "What did the decision to base the water rates on usage reflect?", "context": "Time to clean house in Paso Robles Home\nFront Page » Time to clean house in Paso Robles\nSeptember 5, 2010 Opinion By JIM REED\nI’d like to give you an update on the issue of our civil servants cramming hundreds of millions of dollars in spending down our throats after the people of Paso Robles voted down the water rate increase last November. The rate increase is being hung up in the courts by the City Attorney. What was supposed to be a quick issue to get in front of a judge, has been drug out as long as possible by the City Attorney.\nEven if the courts throw out the current rate increase, I expect that our civil servants will just change a couple of words in the rate increase notice and force the same old plan on us again.\nThere is a real problem with the people we have hired to work for us in Paso Robles. It seems that decisions are made based on some agenda, even if it is contrary to citizens’ wishes.\nCity Councilmen Ed Steinbeck, Nick Gilman and Mayor Duane Picanco, on August 19th, voted unanimously to hire the same law firm employed by the City of Bell. You may have heard the recent news story about the City of Bell’s corrupt city representatives.\nThis law firm allowed the elected officials and City employees to pillage the General Fund for their own benefit, contrary to the rights and interests of the citizens. We are already paying several City employees $12,000 per month with equally ridiculous benefits and pensions. What does this say about our elected representatives?\nI believe most residents are like me. We elect people we believe have our best interest in mind. Over the last few years I have seen that nothing is farther from the truth. The people we have elected have lost track of the fact that “the City” exists to protect and deliver services to the citizens. To them it is some all-important ideal they strive to cultivate and improve according to their agenda. They have forgotten that they are elected to represent the citizens.\nWe have an election coming up in November. We have the opportunity to elect some responsible, principled people to represent us. If we elect more people from within this system, we will get more of the same type of government. We need to look at where the new candidates stand. Will they lawfully represent the citizens of the city? Or, are they happy with the way things are being run?\nWe have stood together in the past and have made real significant changes in important matters that are going to affect our lives for years to come. There are several thousand citizens that made their voice heard on the water issue, more than enough votes to make a change in our city government.\nPlease come out and vote for a democratic representative governing body for Paso Robles instead of the tyrannical leadership that exists now.\nJim Reed is a longtime resident of Paso Robles.\nSubjects: Opinion Paso Robles Paso Robles City Council Vote\tRelated:\n<- Previous Next ->\tEndless Summer Nights at Edna Valley, event photos Trial postponed for Paso Robles woman accused of forgery The comments below represent the opinion of the writer and do not represent the views or policies of CalCoastNews.com.

For purposes of subdivision (a) of Section\n65583, the share of a city or county of the regional housing need\nshall include that share of the housing need of persons at all income\nlevels within the area significantly affected by the general plan of\n(2) While it is the intent of the Legislature that cities,\ncounties, and cities and counties should undertake all necessary\nactions to encourage, promote, and facilitate the development of\nhousing to accommodate the entire regional housing need, it is\nrecognized, however, that future housing production may not equal the\nregional housing need established for planning purposes.\n(b) The department, in consultation with each council of\ngovernments, shall determine each region’s existing and projected\nhousing need pursuant to Section 65584.01 at least two years prior to\nthe scheduled revision required pursuant to Section 65588. The\nappropriate council of governments, or for cities and counties\nwithout a council of governments, the department, shall adopt a final\nregional housing need plan that allocates a share of the regional\nhousing need to each city, county, or city and county at least one\nyear prior to the scheduled revision for the region required by\nSection 65588. The allocation plan prepared by a council of\ngovernments shall be prepared pursuant to Sections 65584.04 and\n65584.05 with the advice of the department.\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the due dates for\nthe determinations of the department or for the council of\ngovernments, respectively, regarding the regional housing need may be\nextended by the department by not more than 60 days if the extension\nwill enable access to more recent critical population or housing\ndata from a pending or recent release of the United States Census\nBureau or the Department of Finance. If the due date for the\ndetermination of the department or the council of governments is\nextended for this reason, the department shall extend the\ncorresponding housing element revision deadline pursuant to Section\n65588 by not more than 60 days.\n(d) The regional housing needs allocation plan shall be consistent\nwith all of the following objectives:\n(1) Increasing the housing supply and the mix of housing types,\ntenure, and affordability in all cities and counties within the\nregion in an equitable manner, which shall result in each\njurisdiction receiving an allocation of units for low- and very low\n(2) Promoting infill development and socioeconomic equity, the\nprotection of environmental and agricultural resources, and the\nencouragement of efficient development patterns.\n(3) Promoting an improved intraregional relationship between jobs\n(4) Allocating a lower proportion of housing need to an income\ncategory when a jurisdiction already has a disproportionately high\nshare of households in that income category, as compared to the\ncountywide distribution of households in that category from the most\nrecent decennial United States census.\n(e) For purposes of this section, “household income levels” are as\ndetermined by the department as of the most recent decennial census\npursuant to the following code sections:\n(1) Very low incomes as defined by Section 50105 of the Health and\n(2) Lower incomes, as defined by Section 50079.5 of the Health and\n(3) Moderate incomes, as defined by Section 50093 of the Health\nand Safety Code.\n(4) Above moderate incomes are those exceeding the moderate-income\nlevel of Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code.\n(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, determinations\nmade by the department, a council of governments, or a city or county\npursuant to this section or Section 65584.01, 65584.02, 65584.03,\n65584.04, 65584.05, 65584.06, 65584.07, or 65584.08 are exempt from\nthe California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing\nwith Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).\npasoobserver says:\t09/13/2010 at 6:52 pm\nTo whatisup —- First of all, I reviewed AB 602 Assembly Bill. Thanks. I am sorry to inform you but AB 602 is not the LAW as you so stated in your blog. I contacted the Deputy Chief Council’s office in Sacramento handling AB 602 to confirm your misstatement of facts. You know,in the English language, It shouldn’t be so difficult to answer some simple questions with a “YES” or “NO” answer. Yet, you are reluctant to do so, but you go on and on with a thesis along with some rhetoric. I never talked about a court suit over the “water issue”, I asked YOU, not about waiting for a court decision. Maybe, you did with some other people. Also, I was not ranting about the wineries usage of water. My response to you on your vague question about “there are people not paying their fair share for their use of water”. I related, are you talking about the wineries? I am well aware that most of the wineries are outside the city limits using the same aquifer. You took my question out of context., nice try! You are just being a popinjay and rhetorical. Also, you didn’t answer another question about “what is the unit cost of water” in Templeton? as compared to Paso Robles.\nwhatisup says:\t09/13/2010 at 8:54 pm\nI am on a well. I am sure you are capable of doing your own homework. I also am quite sure if you really contacted the Deputy Chief Counsel’s Office you have been set straight. What I gave you is a proposed small adjustment in the wide range of laws that make up the California Housing element. I assumed you could stumble onto the facts based on what I gave you. By the way, I believe you can review the Paso Robles Housing element plan on the City’s website or at the Library. The California Housing Element Laws that all cities and counties have to follow have been in place for almost 25 years. I realize you don’t actually have a clue how to look the laws up. Either educate yourself or keep making a fool of yourself, your choice. A simple Google search of California Housing Element Laws will get you going. Good Luck!\nTO WHATISUP — I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT LAW YOU ARE REFERRING TO THAT SAYS “WE” THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE NEW DEVELOPMENT? AGAIN, FOR THE THIRD TIME, YOU FAILED TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS POSED TO YOU IN MY PRIOR RESPONSES TO YOU ON SEPT.10TH &11TH. IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU DON’T WANT TO ANSWER THEM? YOU DO WHAT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS DO SO WELL, AND THAT IS “IN ONE EAR AND OUT OF THE OTHER EAR” IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE EITHER EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OR YOU HAVE OTHER DEALING WITH THE CITY, SO BE IT. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOU THINK THE CITY DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT. APPARENTLY, YOU PRESENT YOURSELF AS BEING VERY BIAS ON CITY DECISIONS. IT LIKE THEY CAN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG ACCORDING TO YOUR LOGIC. THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CITIZENS OF PASO,THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF ARROGANCE ALONG WITH NARCISSISM.\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT DOESN’T PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF WATER? ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE WINERIES USING THE SAME AQUIFER?\nI BELIEVE YOU RELATED THAT YOU RESIDE IN TEMPLETON, BUT YOU OWN PROPERTY IN PASO. BY THE WAY, WHAT IS THE COST PER UNIT OF WATER USAGE IN TEMPLETON COMPARED TO PASO? OF COURSE, TEMPLETON IS IN AN UNINCORPORATED AREA (COUNTY JURISDICTION).\nWELL, I GAVE YOU SOME SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO PAY FOR THE NACIMIENTO WATER PIPELINE AND SEWER TREATMENT PLANT. ALSO, REMEMBER IT’S THE CITIZENS’ MONEY THAT IS BEING SPENT. WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, IS LET THE CITIZENS OF PASO DECIDE WITH THEIR VOTE ON HOW TO FINANCE THIS HUGE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT EXPENDITURE. JUST BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE PROPOSITION 218 AND STOP CIRCUMVENTING THE LAW.\nWOULD YOU OBJECT TO HAVING TO FINANCE SOME NEW BONDS ON YOUR PROPERTY TAX BILL AS A ” SPECIAL TAX” OR AN ASSESSMENT TAX” TO PAY FOR THE NACIMIENTO WATER PIPELINE AND SEWER TREATMENT PLANT? A PERCENTAGE OF PASO CITIZENS FINANCE LOCAL SCHOOL BONDS ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL AND DON’T HAVE ANY KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL. HOW ABOUT THAT COMPARISON FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT? WHAT SAY YOU?\nI say less CapsLock, please.\nwhatisup says:\t09/12/2010 at 11:41 pm\nI have answered your questions. I have been quite detailed in my answers and I am sorry if you can’t deal with the detail. I guess it is your inconvenient truth. You do seem to like to deflect and go around in circles. Another example, now you are ranting about the wineries using the same aquaifier as the City. Let me be clear for you, I don’t like the amount of water the wineries are using. However, the wineries are in the County, not in the City and the City can’t do anything about it. They wineries are allowed to take the water they are taking even if it drops the City’s water levels in their wells. You need to complain to Sacramento. It sounds like you just don’t want to pay anything for the infrastructure because you really just don’t want it built.\nSeveral of your observations of my opinions are bizarre considering I have stated several times I believe the Courts need to decide if Paso Robles has, or has not followed the rules as to funding the infrastucture. Obviously, as I have stated before, if the City loses the lawsuit the infrastructure will have to be paid out of the City’s General Fund until a new method of payment is voted on by the Citizens of Paso Robles. Pretty clear.\nYour idea of charging based on a special assesment rather than the amount of water a property uses means that people who use little water, but live on a more expensive property will pay more than their share, based on their water usage. In addition, how do you deal with a rental unit where the renter is supposed to pay the water bill? Your idea is inherantly unfair, but my guess is it will favor you, so you don’t care if it is unfair and other people would pay part of your share. You also have decided that since I have alternative ideas to yours I must work for, or have business with the City of Paso Robles, another attempt to deflect from the issue. However, once again, I have never worked for the City or have ever done business with the City and don’t expect to ever do business with the City. I do own property in the City which is why I pay attention. Finally, it turns out there needs to be a fix to the housing element laws, the existance of which you are questioning. As I understand it the fix to the housing elemnt laws is because of some lawsuit. This should give you all the information you need to educate yourself on the California Housing Element laws that every city and county in California has to follow:\nBILL ANALYSIS ————————————————————\n|SENATE RULES COMMITTEE | AB 602|\n|Office of Senate Floor Analyses | |\n|1020 N Street, Suite 524 | |\n|(916) 651-1520 Fax: (916) | |\n|327-4478 | |\n———————————————————— THIRD READING\nBill No: AB 602\nAuthor: Feuer (D), et al\nAmended: 8/20/10 in Senate\nSENATE TRANSPORTATION & HOUSING COMM : 6-3, 6/29/10\nAYES: Lowenthal, DeSaulnier, Kehoe, Pavley, Simitian, Wolk\nNOES: Huff, Ashburn, Harman\nASSEMBLY FLOOR : Not relevant\nSUBJECT : Statute of limitations on housing element\nSOURCE : California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation\nHousing California DIGEST : This bill states the intent of the Legislature\nin enacting this bill to modify the courts opinion in Urban\nHabitat Program v. City of Pleasanton (2008) 164\nCal.App.4th 1561, with respect to the interpretation of\nSection 65009 of the Government Code, and revises and\nclarifies statute of limitations and remedies for specified\nhousing related challenges.\nSenate Floor Amendments of 8/20/10 revise the statute of\nlimitations and remedies for specified housing-related\nANALYSIS : The Planning and Zoning Law requires cities\nand counties to prepare and adopt a general plan, including\na housing element, to guide the future growth of a\ncommunity. Following a staggered statutory schedule,\ncities and counties located within the territory of a\nmetropolitan planning organization (MPO) must revise their\nhousing elements every eight years, and cities and counties\nin rural non-MPO regions must revise their housing elements\nevery five years. These five- and eight-year periods are\nknown as the housing element planning period.\nBefore each revision, each community is assigned its fair\nshare of housing for each income category through the\nregional housing needs assessment (RHNA) process. A\nhousing element must identify and analyze existing and\nprojected housing needs, identify adequate sites with\nappropriate zoning to meet its share of the RHNA, and\nensure that regulatory systems provide opportunities for,\nand do not unduly constrain, housing development. The\nreviews both draft and adopted housing elements to\ndetermine whether or not they are in substantial compliance\nwith the law. The Planning and Zoning Law and the Subdivision Map Act\nalso includes a number of sections governing zoning and\nentitlements specifically related to housing, including:\n? The Housing Accountability Act, which requires a city or\ncounty to make one or more specified findings in order to\ndisapprove a particular housing development.\n? A provision requiring cities and counties, when adopting\nan ordinance which limits the number of housing units\nwhich may be constructed on an annual basis, to make\nfindings as to the public health, safety, and welfare\nbenefits that justify reducing the housing opportunities\nof the region. ? Density bonus law, which requires cities and counties to\ngrant a developer a density bonus, incentives, and\nconcessions when the developer proposes to include\nspecified percentages of affordable housing within a\ndevelopment. ? The Least Cost Zoning Law, which requires cities and AB 602\ncounties to designate and zone sufficient vacant land for\nresidential use with appropriate standards to meet\nhousing needs for all income categories and to contribute\nto producing housing at the lowest possible cost.\n? A requirement that, when determining whether to approve a\ntentative subdivision map, a city or county shall apply\nonly those ordinances, policies, and standards in effect\nas of the date the developer’s application is deemed\nPrior to a recent court decision, it was understood that\ncurrent law allowed a party to challenge the adequacy of a\ncity’s or county’s housing element at any time during a\nplanning period, provided that the challenger brought the\naction “in support of or to encourage or facilitate the\ndevelopment of housing that would increase the community’s\nsupply of [affordable] housing.” The challenging party was\nrequired first to serve the city or county with a notice\nidentifying the deficiencies in the housing element. After\n60 days or the date on which the city or county took final\naction in response to the notice, whichever occurred first,\nthe challenging party had one year to file the action in\ncourt. This process and statute of limitations also\napplied to actions brought pursuant to the housing-related\nstatutes listed above. In 2006 Urban Habitat Program brought suit to challenge the\nCity of Pleasanton’s housing policies, including the city’s\nannual cap on housing permits and the city’s cap on the\naggregate number of permissible housing units, both of\nwhich Urban Habitat claimed were insufficient to allow the\ncity to meet its RHNA obligation. In 2008, the First\nDistrict California Court of Appeals issued an unpublished\ndecision in the case of Urban Habitat Program v. City of\nPleasanton allowing the case to proceed with respect to\nsome causes of action, but ruling that the challenge to the\nhousing element itself was time-barred. The court stated:\nAlthough the statute does not specify the time within\nwhich [a deficiency] notice must be given, it is our\nconclusion that the statute must be interpreted as\ncontaining a time limit within which this requirement\nmust be met? In sum, a party bringing a challenge AB 602\ngoverned by section 65009, subdivision (d), has 90\ndays from the date a legislative action is taken or\napproval is given to notify the local land use\nauthority of any claimed deficiencies in such an\naction or approval. Its claim then accrues 60 days\nafter it gives this notice.\nIn other words, instead of being able to initiate a\nchallenge to a deficient housing element at any time during\nthe planning period, housing advocates and other interested\nparties may now only initiate such a challenge by\nsubmitting a deficiency notice within 90 days of the\nhousing element’s adoption.\n1.Removes from the current list of city or county actions\nwhich may be challenged pursuant to Government Code 65009\nnotice and accrual provisions those actions related to\nthe Housing Accountability Act, the Subdivision Map Act,\nand the application of a Density Bonus ordinance to a\nparticular project, all of which are project-specific\nactions. The bill maintains the ability to use these\nnotice and accrual provisions to challenge the adequacy\nof a city’s or county’s density bonus ordinance\n2.Extends lengthening the time in which a deficiency notice\nmay be served to cover all remaining city or county\nactions described in this section of law, as opposed to\njust housing element challenges. In other words, the\namendments apply the longer timeframe to serve the\ndeficiency notice to actions relating to the Least Cost\nZoning Law, annual limits on housing permits, and the\nadequacy of a density bonus ordinance, in addition to\nhousing element law. 3.Provides that an entity challenging such an action in\nsupport of affordable housing may serve the deficiency\nnotice up to five years after the city’s or county’s\naction. After 60 days or the date on which the city or\ncounty takes final action in response to the notice,\nwhichever occurs first, the challenging party has one\nyear to file an action in court, except that the lawsuit AB 602\nmay not be filed more than five years after the city’s or\ncounty’s action. In other words, the entity must file\nthe lawsuit within one year of the expiration of the\ndeficiency notice or within five years of the city’s or\ncounty’s action, whichever occurs first.\n4.Provides that a housing element from a prior planning\nperiod may not be challenged if the city or county has\nadopted a revised housing element for the new planning\nGovernment Code 65755 . Current law requires a court, if it\nfinds any portion of a general plan, including a housing\nelement, out of compliance with the law, to include within\nits order or judgment one or more of the following remedies\nfor any or all types of developments or any or all\ngeographic segments of the city or county until the city or\ncounty has complied with the law:\n? Suspend the authority of the city or county to\nissue building permits.\ngrant zoning changes and/or variances.\ngrant subdivision map approvals.\n? Mandate the approval of building permits for\nresidential housing that meet specified criteria.\n? Mandate the approval of final subdivision maps for\nhousing projects that meet specified criteria.\n? Mandate the approval of tentative subdivision maps\nfor residential housing projects that meet specified\nThis bill clarifies that in any action or proceeding\nbrought pursuant to the notice and accrual provisions of\nGovernment Code Section 65009 described above, neither the\ncourt remedies described above nor any injunction against\nthe development of a housing project shall abrogate,\nimpair, or otherwise interfere with the full exercise of\nthe rights and protections granted to an applicant for a\ntentative map or a vesting tentative map under specified\nprovisions of the Subdivision Map Act or to a developer\nunder a specified provision relating to development AB 602\nUnder current law, HCD operates a number of grant programs\nto which cities and counties may apply. In many cases, the\nlaw requires a city or county to have an HCD-approved\nhousing element in order to be eligible for funding. This bill provides that if a third-party challenges the\nadequacy of a housing element in court and the court finds\nthat the housing element substantially complies with all of\nthe requirements of housing element law, the element shall\nbe deemed to be in compliance for purposes of state housing\nThe statutory language interpreted by the court and at\nissue in this bill was added to statute by AB 998 (Waters),\nChapter 1138, Statutes of 1983, a bill sponsored by the\nLeague of California Cities and the California Building\nIndustry Association. AB 998 created a short statute of\nlimitations period for land use decisions generally but\nprovided a specific exception to protect the ability to\nchallenge deficient housing elements. The Senate Housing\nand Land Use Committee and the Senate Third Reading\nanalysis of the bill stated that the bill:\nSpecifies that for challenges in support of low- and\nmoderate-income housing requirements, the petitioner\nshall notice local government 60 days prior to filing\naction. The [one-year] statute of limitations then\nbegins on the first day the legislative body fails to\nIn the intervening 25 years prior to the Urban Habitat\nruling, housing advocates filed and successfully settled at\nleast ten cases in which the 60-day deficiency notice was\nsent more than 90 days after adoption of the city’s or\ncounty’s housing element. In none of these cases was the\ntimeliness on the advocates’ suit contested. Likewise, six\nbills amended other portions of this statute during those\nintervening years, and there was never any controversy\nsurrounding the lack of a deadline for housing advocates to\nserve a deficiency notice nor any attempt to change the AB 602\nstatute in this regard. Current level of housing element compliance . According to\nHCD’s website as of June 7, 2010, only 46 percent of cities\nand counties have adopted an HCD-approved housing element\nfor the current planning period that began in 2005 for the\nSan Diego region, 2008 for the Southern California, Fresno,\nKern, and Sacramento regions, and the summer of 2009 for\nthe remaining areas of the state. Unlocking the private market . The purpose of housing\nelement law is to create opportunities for the private\nhousing market to function. Builders cannot build without\naccess to appropriately zoned land, and current land use\nplans in many cities and counties in California fail to\nprovide sufficient opportunities to accommodate projected\npopulation growth. The San Diego Association of\nGovernments’ Regional Comprehensive Plan describes this\ntypical California paradox in the following way:\nUnder current plans and policies, more than 90 percent\nof [the San Diego region’s] remaining vacant land\ndesignated for housing is planned for densities of\nless than one home per acre, and most is in the rural\nback country areas dependent upon scarce groundwater\nsupplies. And of the remaining vacant land planned for\nhousing in the 18 incorporated cities, only about\nseven percent is planned for multifamily housing. When\ntaken together, the current land use plans of the 19\nlocal jurisdictions do not accommodate the amount of\ngrowth anticipated in our region. SANDAG’s population\nforecast, which reflects the current adopted local\nland use plans in the region, projects that while\npopulation will increase by 37 percent by 2030,\nhousing will grow by just 30 percent. The forecast\nshows that if local plans are not changed, demand for\nhousing will continue to outpace the supply, just as\nHousing element law addresses this problem directly by\nrequiring cities and counties to zone land at appropriate\ndensities to accommodate the projected housing needs of all\nincome groups and to remove constraints that prevent such\nsites from being developed at the allowed densities. AB 602\nCities and counties, however, are not required to build\nhousing because that is the role of private developers.\nThe law holds cities and counties accountable only for that\nwhich they control: zoning and land use entitlements.\nWithout the ability to enforce housing element law, the\nmarket’s ability to meet housing demand may well remain\nlocked up.\nFISCAL EFFECT : Appropriation: No Fiscal Com.: No\nSUPPORT : (Verified 8/23/10)\nCalifornia Rural Legal Assistance Foundation (co-source)\nHousing California (co-source)\nAdvocates for Affordable Homes in Fremont\nCalifornia Coalition for Rural Housing\nCommunity Housing Improvement Program\nCommunity Housing Works\nEden Housing\nFair Housing of Marin\nGrassroots Leadership Network of Marin\nKennedy Commission\nPublic Advocates, Inc\nSan Diego Housing Federation\nSelf-Help Enterprises\nSierra Club of California\nAmerican Planning Association, California Chapter\nJA:nl 8/23/10 Senate Floor Analyses SUPPORT/OPPOSITION: SEE ABOVE\npasoobserver says:\t09/11/2010 at 11:17 pm\nTo whatisup — Thank you for your response to my comments. However, you failed to answer some of my questions that I mentioned to you. It’s almost like dealing with some City officials. They just let the public vent at their bimonthly council meetings. In my opinion, it’s difficult to deal with narcissism and arrogance. Over the years, there has been some very good input to our elected officials on how to proceed on the Nacimiento water pipeline,but it fell on deaf ears. You wanted me to answer some of your questions,but you did not answer some of my questions. Again, are you willing to subsidize new development?,Yes?or No?, are you willing to pay for a commodity that you are not receiving? Yes?or No? and another question for you. Are you willing to pay over 300% on your water bills within the five (5) year plan that the City has proposed? Also, the water rates will be subject to later increases too. By the way, I do concur with the city’s plan of “you pay for the amount of water units you use”. (748 gal=one unit). However, the higher water rates are not good for our senior citizens on fixed incomes and other struggling families in our community. My first suggestion years ago was desalination. The response was it was too expensive. Of course, now it is more expensive. I would suggest that our elected officials recall the existing bonds (The bonds can be recalled early). The City council can explain to the citizens in detail with financing of new bonds at a lower interest rate as of now for the sewer plant and Nacimiento water pipeline and present their new proposal in compliance with Proposition 218. Let the citizens of Paso VOTE on the financing bonds for their approval. Most of the citizens,that I had spoken to were not happy with the way our City Council handled the Nacimiento water pipeline project. The citizens of Paso didn’t give our City Council a “BLANK CHECK” for $176 million to spend without voter approval. I would suggest that it be a “special tax” or “an assessment” be levied on our property taxes. A percentage of those bonds can be deducted on Federal Income taxes. As it is now, a” fee” on a capital funding project is not deductible. Of course, there are homeowners would not go for this suggestion due to our poor economy. My analogy mentioned above would be, you would get something back on a “special tax” or an “assessment” verses nothing on a “fee”. What say you?\nwhatisup says:\t09/12/2010 at 9:02 am\nUnfortunately the law says we have to subsidize new development in California. I don’t like it, but it is the law. I know paying using the property taxes was bandied about. The argument against it was it would mean some would be paying for water they aren’t using and others could be big water users, but pay a small special assessment on their property taxes. I think the decision that was made to base it on usage was out of fairness. It seems to me if people are using water and not paying their share of the costs it is not fair. The Senior issue is very difficult. If someone is retired for twenty years is it realistic to think prices don’t go up during the 20 years of retirement. Think what prices were in 1990 compared to today. Should Seniors never have to pay for capital improvements? Paso Robles also had very low water rates. Rates that are no longer possible given the circumstances. Desalination will happen eventually. California is out of water. If you want to pay $1,000,000 a gallon there is no more allotable water of any consequence in California. The expense will be tremendous — still have to build a desalination plant, still have to build a pipeline. I don’t know if the plant has to be built along the ocean or if the salt water could be piped over to Paso Robles. If it has to be built along the ocean, Paso Robles doesn’t own land on the ocean and, in any case, the environmentalists will keep it in courts for years as they have done so for other proposed desalination plants in Southern California. Eventually necessity will force desalination past the environmentalists, but not yet.\npasojim says:\t09/13/2010 at 7:46 am\nWhatisup – On one of your previous post you made the comment you haven’t heard any of the legal suggestions for the water issue, But you obviously have. That is a good thing. So we can move the discussion ahead.\nOnce, again this was handled incorrectly by our city custodians from the beginning. And now here we are. The public is not supporting this very expensive, very limited benefit project. As you said, until a plan is developed that the public can support, things don’t look good.\nAll this discussion about the water issue has only reinforced my opinion the issue hasn’t been about water, only how the plan should be paid for. Or more specifically, to what extent do we allow our elected custodians and our un-elected GOD tzar decide which laws they will follow and which laws they will ignore. When the City GOD tzar tell citizens at a council meeting if we don’t agree with the City’s plan, then we should just sue him, and when the City Attorney explains to a citizen at a City Council meeting that she does have to respond to their questions because she does NOT work for them. When the project is voted down by the citizens and the council brings it right back up, it is clear that our elected representatives are not doing their job providing direction to their employees and listening to and representing the CITIZENS.\nThe subject of the original post was the need to elect different representation.

Our approach is based on applying an optimal \"denoiser\" after the action of a noisy circuit and can be performed with an arbitrary number of extra gates.\nThe denoiser is given by an ensemble of circuits distributed with a quasiprobability distribution. For a simple noise model, we show that efficient, local denoisers can be found, and we demonstrate their effectiveness for the digital quantum simulation of the time evolution of simple spin chains. Introduction.\n-Quantum information processing has been theoretically shown to hold great promises, and quantum algorithms were developed which can in principle achieve an exponential speed-up over their classical counterparts, both for general purpose computing and quantum simulation . However, present day quantum computing prototypes still suffer from significant noise processes which hinder the execution of many potentially groundbreaking quantum algorithms .\nNontrivial quantum algorithms typically require large sequences of quantum gates, each of which introduces dissipation and hence an overall loss of coherence, eventually rendering the results useless. Until quantum error correction becomes practical, quantum error mitigation seems to be more feasible to increase the accuracy of expectation values.\nHere the goal is to induce the (partial) cancellation of errors that stem from noisy quantum gates by extending the circuit corresponding to the desired algorithm with an ensemble of gates , sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. The traditional way to accomplish this is with the gatewise method from , where noise is mitigated by inverting the noise channel of each gate separately, i.e. the cancellation of errors is performed for each gate on its own.\nHere the local noise channel is approximated in a way such that it can be easily inverted analytically, e.g. using Pauli twirling . Gates are then sampled from the inverted noise channel by interpreting it as a quasiprobability distribution. Because in this gate-wise approach every noisy gate has to be modified separately, the sign problem is exponentially large in the number of gates, limiting the practicality of the mitigation.\nThe success of the gate-wise approach resulted in a large body of work concerning these methods , including extensions for simultaneous mitigation of multiple gates by Pauli-twirling entire layers or variationally constructing a mitigating matrix product operator . In principle, errors during the execution of a circuit can propagate and accumulate.\nThese propagated errors * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de ≈ C\n\nC\n\nFIG. 1. An example of the quantum error mitigation procedure used in this work for the time evolution of the wave function of a spin chain. The ideal second-order Trotter supercircuit C of depth Mtrot = 1 (light blue) is approximated by applying a denoiser D of depth M = 1 (red) to the noisy Trotter supercircuit C (dark blue).\nBecause the denoiser is applied after fully executing the noisy Trotter supercircuit, it represents an approximate inverse of the global noise channel with a precision tunable by the depth of the denoiser. can potentially blow up and lead to large errors for the circuit as a whole . Here we introduce a mitigation technique that takes into account the propagation of errors, can be performed with a tunable number of extra gates, and works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit.\nWe first execute the targeted noisy circuit completely, letting the noise propagate and accumulate, and only afterwards we apply an extra random circuit sampled from a quasiprobability distribution. We call the corresponding ensemble of random circuits a denoiser, and we construct it such that upon averaging the accumulated errors cancel.\nEssentially, the denoiser inverts a global noise channel. Since we will construct it as a local brickwall circuit, following the classical preprocessing approach from , we call this compressed quantum error mitigation. Method. -Due to the inevitable coupling of a quantum processor to its environment, every qubit operation is affected by noise.\nTherefore, the simplest technique to minimize the impact of the resulting noise is to minimize the number of operations when performing a quantum algorithm. In we showed that many-body time evolution operators can be efficiently compressed into brick-wall circuits with high fidelity per gate. In this Letter, we consider the noise explicitly by treating quantum operations as (generally non-unitary) quantum channels, corresponding to completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps .\nFor example, instead of a noiseless two-qubit gate G, which acts on a quantum state |ρ in superoperator form as G|ρ = G⊗G * |ρ , we get the noisy channel G = N G, where the noise channel N implements the two-qubit noise . These channels are used to construct a \"supercircuit\" C = N G i=1 Gi , consisting of N G channels, which is affected by multi-qubit accumulated noise.\nThis supercircuit encodes an ensemble of circuits . For simplicity, we assume that the noisy channels Gi in each half brickwall layer are lattice inversion and translation invariant, such that we can construct a denoiser with these properties, limiting the number of variational parameters. The purpose of quantum error mitigation is to modify the ensemble of circuits described by C in a way that we can use it to obtain the noiseless expectation values.\nIn superoperator language, we do this by following the supercircuit C with a denoiser supercircuit D, such that D C is as close to the noiseless supercircuit C = C ⊗ C * as possible. Here C is the target unitary circuit. Because the noise channel N is non-unitary, hence making the supercircuit C non-unitary, we need to use a non-unitary denoiser to retrieve the unitary C.\nWe illustrate the mitigation procedure in Fig. , where a denoiser with one layer is used to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with one layer. This circuit architecture is commonly used to simulate the time evolution of a quantum many-body system, until some time t, with controllable precision , and we will use it to benchmark the denoiser.\nIn practice, we cannot directly implement a supercircuit, and so we have to utilize its interpretation as an ensemble of circuits. Essentially, after executing a shot of the noisy circuit we sample the denoiser and apply it. The goal is to construct the denoiser in a way that averaging over many of its samples cancels the accumulated errors and gives us a good approximation of the noiseless expectation values.\nIt should be noted that our approach requires more gate applications on the quantum processor than with the gate-wise scheme, since there each sample from the mitigation quasiprobability distribution can be absorbed into the original circuit, whereas our approach increases the circuit depth. We take this into account by imposing the same noise on the denoiser.\nFurthermore, within our scheme, the dimensionality of the quasiprobabilistic mitigating ensemble can be controlled, in contrast to the gate-wise approach where it is equal to the gate count. To facilitate the stochastic interpretation we parameterize each two-qubit denoiser channel G i as a sum of CPTP maps, such that we can sample the terms in this sum and execute the sampled gate on the quantum processor.\nConcretely, we use a trace preserv-ing sum of a unitary and a non-unitary channel. For the unitary part we take a two-qubit unitary channel U( φ i ) = U ( φ i ) ⊗ U * ( φ i ), with U ( φ i ) a two-qubit unitary gate parameterized by φ i . For this we take the two-qubit ZZ rotation exp(−iα(σ z ⊗ σ z )) with angle α, which can be obtained from native gates on current hardware , and dress it with four general one-qubit unitaries, only two of which are independent if we want a circuit that is space inversion symmetric around every bond.\nThe resulting gate has 7 real parameters φ i . For the non-unitary part, which is essential because D has to cancel the non-unitary accumulated noise to obtain the noiseless unitary circuit, we use a general onequbit measurement followed by conditional preparation channel M( , with V a general one-qubit unitary and each κ i a 3-dimensional vector, resulting in a real 9-dimensional ζ i .\nThis yields the two-qubit correlated measurement M( With these parts we construct the parameterization with coefficients η i ∈ R that satisfy η 0 + η 1 = 1 because G i is trace preserving. Note that here the tensor product symbol corresponds to combining two one-qubit channels to make a two-qubit channel, whereas in most of the paper it is used to link the column and row indices of a density matrix.\nWe construct the denoiser from the noisy channels Gi = N G i . With this parameterization one denoiser channel has 17 independent real parameters, such that a denoiser of depth M , i.e. consisting of M brickwall layers, has 34M real parameters (we use one unique channel per half brickwall layer). For reference, a general channel has 544M parameters.\nTo determine the mitigated expectation values we use the full expression where |ρ 0 is the initial state and |1 is the vectorized identity operator on the full Hilbert space. To evaluate this on a quantum processor, we use the stochastic interpretation of (1) to resample . In particular, from each channel (1) we get a unitary with probability p 0 = |η 0 |/γ and a measurement followed by conditional preparation with probability p 1 = |η 1 |/γ.\nHere γ = |η 0 | + |η 1 | is the sampling overhead, which characterizes the magnitude of the sign problem from negative η i . For quasiprobability distributions, i.e. with γ > 1, every denoiser sample has an extra sign sgn(η) = N G g=1 sgn(η g ), 2. The normalized distance between the denoised Trotter supercircuit D C and the noiseless Trotter supercircuit C (top panels), at evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and the twopoint z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t (bottom panels), for the infinite temperature initial state.\nWe consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and second-order Trotter circuits with depths Mtrot = 16, 32, 64. In the top panels we use a Heisenberg chain with L = 8, and in the bottom panels with L = 14, both with periodic boundary conditions. All gates are affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01.\nThe non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless values with p = 0. where sgn(η g ) is the sign of the sampled coefficient of the gth channel. γ = 1 means that all signs are positive. Observables Ô p=0 for the noiseless circuit are then approximated by resampling the observables from the denoiser ensemble\nwhere γ = N G g=1 γ g is the overall sampling overhead, with γ g the overhead of the gth gate. Clearly, a large γ implies a large variance of Ô p=0 for a given number of samples, with accurate estimation requiring the cancellation of large signed terms. The number of samples required to resolve this cancellation of signs is bounded by Hoeffding's inequality, which states that a sufficient number of samples to estimate Ô p=0 with error δ at probability 1 − ω is bounded by (2γ 2 /δ 2 ) ln(2/ω) .\nSince γ scales exponentially in γ g , it is clear that a denoiser with large M and γ 1 will require many samples. We observed that decompositions with γ > 1 are crucial for an accurate denoiser. Restricting to γ = 1 leads to large infidelity and no improvement upon increasing the number of terms in or the depth M of the denoiser.\nSimply put, probabilistic error cancellation of gate noise introduces a sign problem and it is crucial to find optimal parameterizations (1) which minimize γ to make the approach scalable. This issue arises in all high performance error mitigation schemes , because the inverse of a physical noise channel is unphysical and cannot be represented as a positive sum over CPTP maps.\nThis is clearly visible in the spectra of the denoiser, which lies outside the unit circle (cf. Fig. ). This makes the tunability of the number of gates in each denoiser sample a crucial ingredient, which allows control over the sign problem, because we can freely choose the η i in . For the parametrization (1) of denoiser channels, we try to find a set of parameters for error mitigation by minimizing the normalized Frobenius distance between the noiseless and denoised supercircuits\nwhich bounds the distance of output density matrices and becomes zero for perfect denoising. We carry out the minimization of on a classical processor, using gradient descent with the differential programming algorithm from . Instead of explicitly calculating the accumulated global noise channel and subsequently inverting it, we approximate the noiseless supercircuit C with the denoised supercircuit D C, effectively yielding a circuit representation D of the inverse noise channel.\nResults. -To benchmark the denoiser we apply it to the second-order Trotter circuits of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) where is the Pauli algebra acting on the local Hilbert space of site i. A second-order Trotter circuit for evolution time t with depth M trot consists of M trot − 1 half brickwall layers with time step t/M trot and two layers with half time step .\nWe consider circuits that are affected by uniform depolarizing noise with probability p for simplicity, but our approach can be used for any non-Clifford noise. The two-qubit noise channel is which acts on neighboring qubits i and i + 1 and is applied to each Trotter and denoiser gate, and p = 0.01 unless stated otherwise.\nWe study circuits with depths M trot = 16, 32, 64 for evolution times t = 0.5, 1, ..., 5, and denoisers D with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. In the top panels of Fig. we show (4) for a chain of size L = 8 as a function of time t. Here it can be seen that even for M trot = 32 a denoiser with M = 1 already improves by roughly an order of magnitude at all considered t.\nDepending on M trot and t, further increasing M lowers , with the biggest improvements occurring for high precision Trotter circuits with large depth M trot = 64 and short time t = 0.5, where the Trotter gates are closer to the identity than in the other cases. At the other extreme, for M trot = 16 the improvements are relatively small upon increasing M > 2. In all cases the denoiser works better at early times than at late times, again indicating that it is easier to denoise Trotter gates that are relatively close to the identity.\nTo probe the accuracy of the denoiser on quantities that do not enter the optimization, as a first test we consider the two-point correlator between spins at different times where we have chosen the infinite temperature initial state, and C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t. In the bottom panels of Fig. we show C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) for the supercircuits from the upper panels, now for a L = 14 chain.\nHere we see that at M trot = 16 we can retrieve the noiseless values already with M = 1, but that increasing M trot makes this more difficult. At M trot = 64 we see larger deviations, and improvement upon increasing M is less stable, but nonetheless we are able to mitigate errors to a large extent. As a further test, we compute the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) ]\nIn Fig. we show the results for i = L/2, for a Trotter circuit with depth M trot = 32 and a denoiser with depth M = 2. Here we see that a denoiser with M M trot is able to recover the light-cone of correlations, which are otherwise buried by the noise. In the Supplementary Material we consider how the denoiser performs at different noise levels p, and how the denoised supercircuits perform under stacking.\nThere we also calculate domain wall magnetization dynamics, and show the distribution of the optimized denoiser parameters and the sampling overhead associated to the denoiser as a whole. In Fig. we show the eigenvalues of the noisy supercircuits for a noisy second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 at t = 1 (left), the corresponding optimized denoiser with M = 4 (center), and the denoised supercircuit (right).\nThe eigenvalues λ of a unitary supercircuit lie on the unit circle, and in the presence of dissipation they are pushed to the center. We see that the spectrum of the denoiser lies outside the unit circle, making it an unphysical channel which cures the effect of the noise on the circuit, such that the spectrum of the denoised circuit is pushed back to the unit circle.\nThe noiseless eigenvalues are shown as blue bars, making it clear that the denoiser is able to recover the noiseless eigenvalues from the noisy circuit. In the Supplementary Material we show the spectra for a p = 0.036 denoiser, where we observe a clustering of eigenvalues reminiscent of Refs. . There we also investigate the channel entropy of the various supercircuits .\nConclusion. -We have introduced a probabilistic error cancellation scheme, where a classically determined denoiser mitigates the accumulated noise of a (generally non-Clifford) local noise channel. The required number of mitigation gates, i.e. the dimensionality of the corresponding quasiprobability distribution, is tunable and the parameterization of the corresponding channels provides control over the sign problem that is inherent to probabilistic error cancellation.\nWe have shown that a denoiser with one layer can already significantly mitigate errors for second-order Trotter circuits with up to 64 layers. This effectiveness of low-depth compressed circuits for denoising, in contrast with the noiseless time evolution operator compression from , can be understood from the non-unitarity of the denoiser channels.\nIn particu-lar, measurements can have non-local effects, since the measurement of a single qubit can reduce some highly entangled state (e.g. a GHZ state) to a product state, whereas in unitary circuits the spreading of correlations forms a light-cone. To optimize a denoiser with convenience at L > 8, the optimization can be formulated in terms of matrix product operators or channels , which is convenient because the circuit calculations leading to the normalized distance and its gradient are easily formulated in terms of tensor contractions and singular value decompositions .\nThis provides one route to a practical denoiser, which is relevant because the targeted noiseless circuit and the accompanying noisy variant in (4) need to be simulated classically, confining the optimization procedure to limited system sizes with an exact treatment or limited entanglement with tensor networks.\nNonetheless, we can use e.g. matrix product operators to calculate (4) for some relatively small t, such that the noiseless and denoised supercircuits in (4) have relatively small entanglement, and then stack the final denoised supercircuit on a quantum processor to generate classically intractable states.\nAnalogously, we can optimize the channels exactly at some classically tractable size and then execute them on a quantum processor with larger size. Both approaches are limited by the light-cone of many-body correlations, as visualized in Fig. , because finite-size effects appear when the light-cone width becomes comparable with system size.\n1. The normalized distance (left) and z spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (right), for a second-order Trotter supercircuit of depth Mtrot = 16 for time t = 1, affected by various twoqubit depolarizing errors p. We compare the values obtained with and without a denoiser, i.e. M > 0 and M = 0, to the noiseless values (p = 0).\nThe denoiser is affected by the same noise as the Trotter circuit. We consider denoisers with depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and we use a L = 8 Heisenberg chain with PBC for the normalized distance, while for the correlator we use L = 14. * david.luitz@uni-bonn.de to observe that even for larger noise strength p, the local observable C zz improves significantly even with denoisers of depth M = 1.\nFor large noise strengths, we generally see that the optimization of the denoiser becomes difficult, leading to nonmonotonic behavior as a function of p, presumably because we do not find the global optimum of the denoiser. It is interesting to analyze the spectra of the supercircuits considered in this work.\nAs mentioned in the main text, the spectrum of the ideal, unitary supercircuit C lies on the unit circle. The comparison to this case is therefore instructive. In the main text, we showed an example of the spectra in Fig. for moderate noise strength. Here, we show additional data for stronger noise p = 0.036 in Fig. for a denoiser with M = 4 layers, optimized to mitigate errors for a second-order Trotter supercircuit with M trot = 16 layers at time t = 1.\nThe eigenvalues λ of the noisy supercircuit C are clustered close to zero, far away from the unit circle (except for λ = 1), showing that the circuit is strongly affected by the noise. To mitigate the impact of the noise, the denoiser consequently has to renormalize the spectrum strongly. If it accurately represents the inverse of the global noise channel, its spectrum has to lie far outside the unit circle, which is the case.\nInterestingly, we observe a clustering of eigenvalues which is reminiscent to the spectra found in . By comparison to these works, we suspect that this is due to the local nature of the denoiser, and warrants further investigation. The right panel of Fig. shows the result of the denoiser, pushing the eigenvalues back to the unit circle, nearly with the exact same distribution along the circle as the noiseless eigenvalues (blue bars).\nDue to the strong noise, this is not achieved perfectly, and it is clear that this cannot work in principle if the global noise channel has a zero eigenvalue. The complexity of an operator can be quantified by its operator entanglement entropy . Here we calculate the half-chain channel entanglement entropy S of the noiseless C, noisy C, denoiser D, and denoised D C supercircuits.\nWe define S as the entanglement entropy of the state that is related to a supercircuit C via the Choi-Jamio lkowski isomorphism, i.e. ψ C = χ C /N , where the process matrix χ ab,cd C = C ac,bd is simply a reshaped supercircuit and N ensures normalization. Then we have S = −Tr [ψ C ln ψ C ]. This entropy measure is a particular instance of the \"exchange entropy\", which characterizes the information exchange between a quantum system and its environment .\nIn Fig. we plot the various S for a second-order Trotter circuit with M trot = 16 at t = 2, for a denoiser with M = 4, both affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p ∈ [10 −3 , 10 −1 ]. The Trotter circuit is for a Heisenberg model with L = 6 and PBC. We see that at large p, the noise destroys entanglement in the noisy supercircuit, and that the denoiser S increases to correct for this, such that the denoised supercircuit recovers the noiseless S.\nHere we investigate how denoised supercircuits perform upon repeated application. We optimize the denoiser for a Trotter supercircuit for a fixed evolution time t. Then, to reach later times, we stack the denoised supercircuit n times to approximate the evolution up to time nt: In Fig. we stack a denoised t = 1 supercircuit up to n = 20 times and calculate the correlation function, defined in the main text, for the middle site.\nWe consider Trotter depths M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, for a L = 14 Heisenberg chain with p = 0.01 depolarizing two-qubit noise. The noisy results correspond to M = 0 and the noiseless results to p = 0. In Fig. we calculate the OTOC, defined in the main text, with stacked time evolution for a denoised t = 2 supercircuit with M trot = 32 and M = 2, stacked up to ten times.\nWe see that the stacked supercircuit performs very well, and the additional precision obtained by using deep denoisers (M = 8) pays off for long evolution times, where we see convergence to the exact result (black dashed lines in Fig. ) as a function of M . FIG. . The two-point z-spin correlator C zz i=L/2,j=L/2 (t) of a spin on the middle site at times 0 and t, for the infinite temperature initial state, for denoised second-order Trotter supercircuits that are optimized at evolution time t = 1 and then stacked up to twenty times.\nWe use Trotter depths Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 and denoiser depths M = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8. The calculations were performed for a periodic Heisenberg model with L = 14 and PBC, affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with strength p = 0.01, which also affects the denoiser. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0, and the noiseless results with p = 0.\nThe panels are arranged as Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 for top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively. The costliest and most noise-susceptible operation is the two-qubit ZZ rotation with angle α, which is the foundation of the unitary piece in our channel parameterization, defined in the main text.\nFor completeness, we here present the α angles of the optimized denoisers. The results are shown in Fig. , which contains histograms for the channel count N G versus α. The histograms are stacked, with the lightest color corresponding to the angles of the denoiser at t = 0.5 and the darkest at t = 5. The top four panels are for a denoiser with M = 2 and the bottom four with M = 8.\nWe consider M trot = 8, 16, 32, 64. We see that in both cases the distribution widens upon increasing M trot , indicating that the unitary channels start deviating more from the identity. Moreover, while the M = 2 denoisers in all cases except M trot = 64 have ZZ contributions close to the identity, this is clearly not the case for M = 8.\nFor simplicity, we did not focus on obtaining denoisers with the smallest sampling overhead γ, which is required to minimize the sign problem and hence ease the sampling of mitigated quantities. Instead, we let the optimization freely choose the η i in the denoiser parameterization, as defined in the main text.\nIn Fig. we show the sampling overhead of the denoisers from Fig. of the main text. We see that for M = 1 and M = 2 the sampling overhead is relatively small and uniform across the different t, whereas for M > 2 the optimization sometimes yields a denoiser with large γ and other times with small γ. This could be related to the difference in α distributions from Fig. .\nThe large fluctuations of γ appears to stem from the difficulty in finding optimal deep denoisers, and our optimization procedure likely only finds a local minimum in these cases. Here C(t) is the Trotter supercircuit for time t.

{"input": "How can you level up in the early levels?", "context": "What is this game all about? (short version) Do you like the board game RISK®? Then chances are you’ll like QONQR. Your job is to join a faction and help your faction (team) take over the world. QONQR is an artificial intelligence that appeared on the Internet. We don’t know where it came from, or its purpose, but we know it is powerful. The Legion want to destroy QONQR because they believe it will enslave and exterminate humanity. The Swarm believe QONQR will advance the human race, and we should protect it. The Faceless don’t care, and want to steal the technology for their own uses. Pick a side, recruit your friends, and help your faction capture the towns and cities in which you live, work, and play. What is this game all about? (long version) Right now an invisible war is raging all around you. At stake: the Past, Present, and Future. A rogue Artificial Intelligence has been detected infiltrating the world’s networked infrastructure. Initial hacking of the source code has revealed incredible new technology. It is not certain whether this AI seeks to enhance or destroy humanity. It is only certain that it is here, and that is has a name: QONQR.Those who first detected the presence of QONQR on the global networks have argued fiercely over its intentions. They have split into viciously rival Factions, each co-opting the known QONQR technologies for their own ends. Even now the Factions battle over the entire globe seeking to gather resources and prepare for the coming power struggle. Whether you accept it or not, the war is here. Your survival, prosperity, and even glory depend on the choices you make and the skill you demonstrate from this point forward. You will be asked to join one of three Factions. The choice should not be made lightly. Your Faction Alignment will define your place in the war over QONQR. THE LEGION unite under the shared goals of destroying QONQR and saving humanity by crushing the nascent AI before it can mature. They are led by AGENT SUNDAY, a former commander of the NSA's Turing Task Force which has been valiantly stamping out dangerous AIs for years. THE SWARM are convinced that QONQR promises an era of unprecedented technological advancement and human prosperity. Nanobot weaponry expert KIMYO NAGUMO leads this faction in the battle to defend QONQR and assemble its future tech, accelerating humanity's path into the future. THE FACELESS are a loosely organized faction of militant hackers who want QONQR's technology for their own ends, but want to prevent the unavoidable nightmare of human slavery they believe it portends. When they choose to communicate, they do so through an anonymous vigilante who goes by the name PROMETHEUS. . What do I do first? Create a base, then launch. Launch nanobots until your fingers hurt. How do I create a base? On iOS there is a Base icon in the menu bar. For Windows Phone, you will find a bases button on the home screen. These take you to the Base Screen where you can see how many bases you have available to you. Once you create a base, be sure harvest often by returning to the list of your bases. You can see how full each base is by checking the fill percentage icon. Bases stop collecting once they are full. What is the point of creating bases and harvesting resources? You need bases to earn money. Bases collect rare elements over time which you can then harvest for your faction in exchange for qredits. Qredits can be used to purchase ordinance (like nanomissiles) and upgrades which will help you capture and hold battle zones more easily. What do you mean, “launch nanobots?” Nanobots are the invisible soldiers generated by your device (which has been transformed into “Scope” by advanced QONQR technology). Nanobots fight for control of the battle zones around you.. From the home screen click “Current Zone”. Once you have selected your zone, you will be able to deploy nanobots there.. Initially, you are just a level 1 recruit. You are only going to get a small attack formation with a limited range.. Other solders have to practice with rifles before they get tanks; you are no different. Once you prove your mettle, you’ll get access to bigger weapons. Soon you’ll be lobbing missiles hundreds of miles. How do I capture a zone? If you play for the Legion and are launching nanobots into a zone controlled by the Swarm, you will capture the zone for the Legion as soon as you have destroyed enough of the enemy that your nonbots outnumber theirs. If you are the person who causes the zone to change control to the Legion, you will be listed as the Capturer of the Zone. The Person with the most nanobots in the zone is the zone leader. What is my current zone? How do you know? Your current zone is determined by your proximity to the nearest zone center. So, while you might be inside the governmental boundaries of a city, your scope (phone) could tell you your current zone is a different city, if that city’s center is closer. So I just keep deploying? Yes, in the early levels of the game, just keep deploying and harvesting your bases. You will earn XP (experience points) proving your loyalty to your Faction.\tYou will level up quickly and soon have access to many more options. So all I can do is just attack? You only get assault bots to start. They are the most basic type of nanobot formation. As you level up you will get many more options, including bots that are good at defense, energy attacks, long-range deployments, formations that will buff the shields for all your faction-mates in the zone, and many more. My faction already controls this zone should I still attack? Yes, assault bots won’t attack your friends. You will increase the bot counts for that zone, which will deter opponents. Attack bots can defend your zone; they just aren’t very good at it. As you level up you will unlock defensive formations that are better for deploying if your faction already holds the zone. I’ll never knock out my enemy at this rate! In the first few levels your impact might feel minimal, but every deployment helps you gain experience. It won’t take long to level up if you keep at it. If you are unlucky enough to be in a zone where someone has already built up huge defenses, you may be in for a long fight. But remember, your scope moves with you. Go explore the world and find softer targets. Once you level up, it won’t seem like a toy gun against a battleship. You’ll get your big weapons once you prove yourself. We have already seen operatives brag about taking down 1,000,000 nanobots in just a couple days. Nothing is impossible. How do I attack a different zone? As you level up you will unlock more and stronger formations. Those new formations will have range. While at the early levels you can only attack nearby zones, as you level up your attacks will go 10-20 miles (roughly 15-30 Km) and you will eventually gain access to nanomissiles that can go hundreds of miles. What should I buy in the depot first? The smallest thing to buy is a refresh. We give you some of these as you level up so you can try them out. Refreshes will refill (or partially fill depending on the size of your tank) your bot bar or your energy bar. But after that, it depends on your goals. There is much to choose from. Do you want to be able to deploy more nanobots on every launch? Do you want to boost your offensive or defensive bots? Do you want to be able to launch missiles into towns far away? All of these things are possible. Look through the depot and see what you like. Most of the time you will need to buy an upgrade before you can buy the ordinance. For example, missiles are fairly inexpensive, but you need to buy the MX Rack Missile Launcher before you can launch them. Buy the upgrade first. What is the difference between qredits and cubes in the depot? A qredit (aka: credit, which looks like the child of a Q and € ) is the type of currency you earn in the game by harvesting your bases. Cubes (aka: power cubes) are purchased with real money in the Bank section of the Depot. We want everyone to be able to do everything in the game for free, by earning qredits, but for those who want to move a bit faster, you can purchase cubes to speed things along. Purchasing cubes is how QONQR makes money. We very much appreciate your support. Every purchase you make helps us to keep making improvements in the game. Future enhancements will enable you to earn cubes in game. Why can’t I create another base? Additional bases become available as you level up. At the start, you will get a new base every 5 levels. If you don’t have any more bases available to build, you will need to level up. If you have a base available, but aren’t allowed to use it, it is because you already have a base in that zone. You can only have one base in a zone. Get yourself to another zone, then create your base there. My bases are collecting credits at different rates. Your bases collect resources faster if your faction controls the zone. Do your best to either put your bases in zones you can control by yourself, or find zones with strong players in the same faction and put your bases there to maximize your credit collection. The game says I’m in a town that doesn’t exist. QONQR tracks almost 3 million battle zones of varying strategic value in 250 countries. Sometimes those zones include locations that haven’t existed for over 100 years. That’s pretty cool if you ask us. If you find a zone that looks like a duplicate or is just plain wrong, however, let us know on the forums under “Zone Corrections”. How do I move my current position on the map? You might need to take a car, bus, plane or train depending on which zone you are trying to get to, but if you want to move on the map, you need to move in the real world. QONQR is a location-based game, which means you play where you are. However we don't want to make you move to play, we want you to plan when you move. QONQR goes with you as you move through the daily activities in your life. Where do I find the Strategy Guide? Here: http://community.qonqr.com/index.php?/topic/1191-the-official-qonqr-strategy-guide/ How do I win? That is for you to decide. There is still much to discover. We don’t even know if QONQR is good or evil. Why is it here? What is its purpose? Help your faction further its goals and unlock all the secrets of QONQR!\nCongratulations to the Swarm on their overwhelming victory in Atlantis in May 2015 -- taking and retaining all Atlantis zones from beginning to end is hard to argue with -- most convincing -- well done Swarm!\nRumor has it that the Duggers have 20 scopes. Some families really do have a wife and ten kids... Ha Anyways.... Multi scoping is generally not encouraged, usually if you mention that you do it on the forums or in groupme your not going to be a very liked person, even within your own faction. What tends to happen is if you start multiscoping then your enemies start doing it, then you get into a war where ever person has 6 phones and nobody is happy. I've seen or heard about situations like this in a lot of different locations.\nGreat job, faceless! It was actually an exciting Atlantis and I prefer it that way. Way to bring your A game.\nYou know what we need in this game? Nano-Nukes!!\nAttention (insert faction here), We, the (insert faction here) are tired of the way you constantly (circle one).. A. Cube rage us B. Bully us with numbers C. Talk mean to us It hurts our feelings because (circle one).. A. We don't cube B. We don't have as many allies C. We have no sense of humor and/or no backbone Please refrain from participating in the above selected actions for above selected reasons so as the game is enjoyable for (insert faction here). Regards, (insert name and faction here) There we go...this should streamline the entire complaint process of the forums. Copy and reuse as needed. You're welcome.\nSilver, you mentioned in a blog that there are levels beyond 150, is it safe to say there is no level limit anymore or is that for us to discover? Another question, I'm not sure if I'm the only one noticing this but it seems like bot decay doesn't work against Zone Assault bots. I've hit two players I know have been inactive for well over 6 months but my attack had the same effect it did yesterday before the update. However I did notice against Deflection bots I am getting 2x the kill power. Also in response to decontaminatoR. Paid gaming isn't just something for adults. When I was 13 the best options for handheld gaming was GameBoy or GameGear and the games at the time cost anywhere between $29-$39 dollars. I had a paper route to pay for my games. So, no offense, but you can afford $0.99 for a game. You don't even need a paper route, just check under your couch cushions and I'm sure you'll find a few quarters.\nI want to start by thanking Faceless. This round of Atlantis, Legion and Faceless were doubled in sized and probably spending by Swarm. I contacted some great players from the other side and put together a nonaggression pact, this pact was one of the most impressive agreements I've seen in the more than two years of playing. Hundreds of people worldwide stuck to this agreement and put past feelings behind us. It was awesome to see both sides stick so closely to each other in fighting against Swarm. I want to really thank everyone who showed honor by standing behind me and the faceless command when we suggested that, the people who really gave it a chance and then most importantly, to all the players who honored it. Faceless, thank you very much! We stood no chance of winning without you! The battle came down to literally one launch in one of three zones. I'd say that with that being said everyone fought incredibly hard, so I want to give Swarm the respect they deserve. You guys really show out and play to win. Good game, 2 against 1 is not easy, no matter how large your crew is. And Legion, we had many late, late nights, many very long days. You guys killed it this month! We didn't take home a trophy, but I would say we all have something to be proud of! The other leaders who helped me coordinate everything were awesome! So many great people kept everything moving forward 24 hours a day for the whole week. Thank you to everyone who gave it your all for the whole week even when we saw that Swarm had 4x our bots at the end of just one day. Many people would have given up, but we held in and **** near won! I've won Atlantis battles with Faceless and with Legion but I will say, nothing was as fun or incredible as this round! You guys are fantastic and I can't wait to do it all again next month! Hopefully we have more Legion and Faceless show up for the next round, but I know that even if we don't, we will figure out a way, just as warriors do. PEW! PEW! PEW!\nI must start with an announcement: Camels are not the only animal in the middle east. You have overused it already. It's saddens me that anyone would still find it funny. Get a bit of originality. For anyone not wanting to read all this drivel, skip to the end (hint: Bold stuff). At what point have I bullied anyone? When was the last aggressive or threatening message you or any of your members received from me? Never. Legion and Swarm (in the UK) have teamed up because Faceless are dominating in London. That makes sense. It's a three sided fight and if one force becomes too powerful, the other two can join forces to try and take them down. But: We are dominating in the London area while your alliance is attacking players outside of that area. Then you expect me to sit back and do nothing. You are specifically using me as an excuse for why you have teamed up but then you're attacking players outside of my reach, sometimes with Europe involved. If that is not reason enough to attack you then I'm not sure what is. You lot cube, multiscope and have multi faction accounts and still complain. I don't complain about anything you do. Play the way you want to, ill do the same. I am never rude to anyone, always polite no matter what the message is, never brag about what I do, can do or have done, never threaten anyone, try and keep in touch with the few swarm or legion who are civilised to me, listen to any message form any side and if I can help in any way, I try my best to. Formed agreements with enemy (that I didn't need to) that ended up slapping me in the face. I have even in the past taken the time to find out who some of the younger players are so I know to avoid them. When I'm in a different country I try and find who the bullies are. Those players who threaten and brag and laugh at others. Those are my targets (if they exist in those areas). I don't see how anyone can think I'm a bully. Is it your money? Its none of your business how I spend it. Either way your numbers are way off. 700 dollars a day? Did you just decide to blindly strike the number pad to come up with that figure? Best part of one of your posts is saying that the devs should worry about my welfare. What concerns you about me spending my money? Maybe I'll self harm due to overspending? I wont have enough to buy food because I bought too many cubes? I don't understand what they are supposed to worry about. I have issues? At what point did you deduce this oh mighty psychologist? Wait a minute are you my bank account manager? What do you know about how much I can or cant afford? Random guy spends money on something he enjoys. The end. Told you last time to give up on all the drama but I guess thank you for the concern. You play to make me spend more? And? What do you think that accomplishes? In fact how do you even make me spend? You don't even attack me. You sulk when I'm in the UK and when I fly out and you find out, you call in Europe to help you take an zone or two. As they say, whatever floats your boat. As for Atlantis: Please try again. I quit Atlantis when we were winning. I have on occasion involved myself after I was asked to help out but on the whole I give it a miss. The last time (months ago) was the last 10 minutes of Atlantis and Legion fought hard. We lost. I was not the only Faceless player to quit Atlantis. Quite a few of us thought it lasted too long and had too many zones to fight over. I hear the duration has been reduced. You can't honestly believe I changed my sleeping pattern for the game. I was in California for a month. I was jet lagged. My sleeping pattern was a bit off when I got back. You're not even accurate about when I deploy. Pay attention. You should know this by now: I play as and when I want, sometimes every 20 minutes and sometimes I do long stretches and sometimes I'm busy and don't deploy for hours. You wont always win, and nor will I. Try and get satisfaction form at least trying to win or putting up a good fight. About the limit on cubing. Please. I suggested that last year. Twice. Unfortunately multiscoping is allowed and so prevalent that it kind of ruins the idea. These are the facts: YOU and YOUR side threatened Faceless members who support London. One of the members threatened is actually London based. What do you expect him to do while his city is under attacked? A few of your members don't know when to keep quiet. They sent messages to us threatening specific players and telling them their zones will be dropped just because they have helped London. Basically if they help London then they get their zones wiped. And you have the cheek to call me a bully? We stood up to your members specifically because they were trying to bully. That is the reason we went strong months ago and took those big zones. How is this me bullying you? This is me answering your threats. I didn't attack those zones \"just because i can\", it's just because I should. Because of your threats. You can blame your members for the loss of those 2 or 3 big zones. These are the basics: You attack one of our zones. We look at the list of attackers and pick one of the players who deployed the most, find a zone of his or hers and attack it. We don't need to justify our attacks with \"because there are Faceless players within 30 miles\". What, every time we attack a zone we need to send some letter explaining why? You attack us or we attack you, for any reason. That's the game. When some of you were cheating and you could not win you complained, when you cube and lose you complain, when you invite all of Europe to attack and win you still complain. I just think you like to make a fuss. Last words (for now): You think I attack zones as a means of getting attention? I get enough of it form your threads. The only attention seeker here is you with your victim attitude and pity us posts.\nI've had some very angry emails today from a couple users who are upset their rival achieved the ability to switch factions freely having played for one of the factions for only 1 hour. I've been accused of doing favors, changing the rules, and various other backhanded deals. It appears it comes down reading the rules. You do not have to play for every faction for 60 days in order to earn free switching status. Here is a common scenario many players have used to achieve free switching status and avoiding playing for one faction they despise. 1. Start with Swarm 2. Switch to Legion (earn Spy) play for 60 days 3. Switch back to Swarm (earn Double Agent) play for 60 days 4. Switch to Faceless (earn Mercenary) immediately switch back to Swarm or Legion Below is the complete text on the switch nanobots screen. It is the same text that has been there from Day 1 with the exception of the level 100 rules that went into place earlier this year, where you could switch as much as you want before level 100 , but those switches don't count towards the medals. This text has been part of this description since Jan 15, 2013. \"Players that earn all three spy awards, may once again switch factions at any time as they could during the training levels 1 through 99.\" Prior to Jan 15, the text said this. \"Players that earn all three awards may be given the opportunity to switch factions more quickly in future updates (contact support for more information)\" I pulled that right out of source control, which includes the entire change history. Here is the complete text from this page. http://portal.qonqr....r/SwitchFaction WARNING: Defection has consequences! Self-destruct will be initiated on all your nanobots. Without the self-destruct, you would be required to battle against your former self to regain control of your zones. You will lose the capture and leadership of any zones you currently hold. Lifetime captures will be unaffected. If you are still completing the training levels and have not reached Level 100, you may switch as often as you like to find the faction that suits you best. Once you have reached Level 100 switching factions has rewards, but also has additional consequences beyond the self-destruct of all your nanobots. Defection will usually result in a demotion in rank. This is accomplished through awards with negative rank points. Those awards are: Spy - First switch to an opposing faction (-20 points) Double Agent - Return to a faction from which you had previously defected (-20 points) Mercenary - Become a member of all three factions (-20 points) Other Faction Change Details: You may not switch factions again until at least 60 days have passed since your last faction switch. Defection point penalties are applied only once per award Players that earn all three spy awards, may once again switch factions at any time as they could during the training levels 1 through 99. The decision to switch factions is one that must be made with strong determination. Nanobots cannot be reanimated once destroyed. You will retain your earned experience, level, formations, qredits, cubes, and upgrades. However, as far as your zones go, you will be starting over.\n...has got to be one of the funniest moments I've seen in qonqr yet lol.\nThe **** change operation was a success!\nAs a relatively new player for faceless in a region dominated by swarm i can understand the OP. However, judging from the numbers i see here on a regular basis i think you are asking a bit much. My idea would be the opposite approach. Why not add a weapon with extremely short range, let's say like 5km that acts like a bomb and make it much stronk? That would add some serious home advantage. Or alternativley make attack formations lose power over range (exclude nanos and plasma). Maybe something like that would allow newcomers to at least get a foothold in their homezones. It's just an idea, maybe i overlooked something?\nThis is by design. Some day it is possible (I said someday) we could offer skins for your scope. So we will need a uniform color scheme. You can tell the formation families based on the shape of the box. Trapezoid is attack, diamond is defense, and octagon is support. It will take some time to get comfortable with the change.\nGeophysical based game. Anyways, probably not a bad idea but, considering the issues with the three platforms and the development of blue for those platforms, I doubt the resources are available for development on a new platform. Seen the blog? Its Qonqr meets wheel of fortune!\nI am happy to announce that today I both completed the training and captured my first zone.\n^THIS so now that qonqr has been thoroughly funded, can we have blue now? Or is that not happening still lol.\nAtleast I am not legion and there for we can have this intelligent discussion rather than just compete over who has the best words XD ohhhhh someone bring the bill to legion cuz someone just served them extra double order of stir fried SNAPPPPPP If the devs wont make zone dueling for us I hope out there somewhere are those who would empty a zone and challenge one on one to a local battle. I'd like to see the transcript of deployments made / moves made as well that would be neat I think such events would be cool. I suppose if people give up on atlantis as it works now they can schedule their own tournements in empty atlantis zones.. have a team clear the zone.. put 1 vs 1 or teams vs teams.. like fisticuffs challenges.. find out what these warriors are really made of!\n@Qonqrd everyone you know must face palm every time you make a post. Its embarrassing. Mega cubers or whatever you want to call them are not great for the opposing team surrounding them but are great for the game itself (money) and for the team they are part of. Multiscopers are not not great for the opposing team surrounding them and bring nothing to the game but are great for the team they are part of. Both have a negative impact on enemy teams/players but only one benefits the game itself. Both can make people want to quit out of frustration. And that's not great for the game. @OP unlimited refresh is over powered. Its frustrating to fight against a ridiculous amount of refreshes. Unfortunately i dont see anything changing unless this game gets a lot more people playing. More people might mean more money for the company from various sources. More money from various players might mean they can limit the players who spend a ton and still generate a healthy income. The main issue i see with limiting refreshes is someone multiscoping and spending money. He now has two, three, four accounts to refresh with and gets the advantage. Its tricky.\ney dun new ho to yet it uff.\nYet you complain almost everyday here, on your website, Twitter, and YouTube channel that the game needs to change because cubing has such an impact.\nIt was fun. Swarm had me scared at first, but it turned into kind of a bullying match between us and legion. Last hour became p obvious which way it was gonna go. Legion rly stepped up their game in the end there, respect.\nWe are investigating this. Here is what we know: Several of the accounts used the same password. Most of the accounts belonged to people who knew each other personally. The accounts were all switched from the same IP Addresses. The person who logged in, got into each account on the first attempt, so they knew the password for each account. What you should know: QONQR never stores passwords, not even in the logs. Passwords are hashed (one way encrypted) and can never be decrypted When you authenticate to our servers, we hash the password you gave us and compare it to the encrypted password in the database to see if they match. Access to our database in the could is restricted tightly and we are confident no one breached the system. What you should do: Don't use the same password as other people you play with. Don't share your password with anyone.\nI heard all the French players fled to the UK after one German player accidentally shot a single missile into France.\nMost factions now use GroupMe or Line as their means of communication, the forums are too slow as a means of communication and insecure for specific faction conversations. Think of the forums are more of a gaming information resource rather than a means of communication. Contact the top players of your faction in the leader boards of your state and they will likely point you in the right direction to chatting with your local faction. The developers are also building some sort of new chat system into the game, we don't know much about it but apparently beta testing for the chat will be happening very soon (next couple of weeks) according to their timelines.\nA way to honor the dead? Nah, how bout a way to dishonor the dead.\nCould just build it up and retain their capture. Remember Bizzy, staq to the heavens.\nI just read this entire thread. I am now tuckered.\nDoes anyone know if Bot Booster has an effect on Seekers and how much dmg they do to attacking players? Also on the topic of seekers, does the amount of skeers in a battlefield have any effect on how much damage they do?\nInteractive map of real-time zone captures.\nYou know that is something I didn't factor in there. Time. The player who can consistently and constantly launch wins against the guy who casually picks up the phone on occasion or has to work away from a cell phone for 8 hours. Good point. And yes I can't argue skill doesn't factor in, it just seems like less of a factor than other games is all.\nI cant see why a closed forum, open only to registered Qonqr accounts, cant be used. **** spammers!\nGotta love synclock! I suspect linjin has a problem. Maybe the dvs should look into it.\nNo, Naamah...I clearly understood what you were trying to convey. I'll even go as far as to agree that what your facing now is, while fully allowed and deemed completely acceptable by the developers, unbalanced and wrong. However..the imbalance isn't in the game and isn't something that, from a business standpoint, is likely to be regulated. The game is fair..the advantages are provided to all players. It's the players themselves that throw the balance into chaos because, as you've said, not everyone can afford spending several thousand bucks a year in only one game. Truthfully, in my opinion, the moment you admitted to buying cubes yourself your complaint became silly..because I'm sure there's a player out there, who has bought NO cubes, who can make this same complaint about you that you are making about others here. I know these things because I've read them so...many...times in this forum. There was likely a time, ages ago when I was a young Massune, that I even posted a few myself. That was the purpose of my post..I was poking fun at addition of yet another cuber/bully/trash talk complaint on the forum. It wasn't directed at your personal plight so much as the idea that someone, yet again, finds it necessary to lobby for a spending cap on the only real way for this game to make money. As to your specific problem..you, like all those that have raised this topic before you, have few options to rectify the issue. Here are a few that seem to have worked for others..fight harder, recruit better, spend less time complaining and more time organizing, budget for more cubes or quit. I'd rather not see you opt for the latter..but to each their own.\nI agree, we should find a way to honor the dead, but I don't think keeping their towers infinitely is necessarily the solution. The game must go on. I'm pretty sure the point of bot decay was to clear the game of inactive player bots so that new players can have a chance to rise up, not to dishonor the bots of dead players.\nThe following are frequently asked questions about the new server update (so far) It still says Training Complete on my iPhone. -\tDownload the update from iTunes It still says Training Complete on my Android. -\tSorry, Android will not be updated again until the QONQR Blue beta is released My XP per launch keeps going down -\tThis is XP throttling and is intended to limit the ability for people to leve1 from 1 to 100 in a single day through heavy cubing. The XP throttle was introduced with the original version of QONQR in 2012,and the throttle formula is the same for levels above 100. The throttle resets at midnight UTC every day. How do I buy the Bot Regeneration Accelerator? -\tCurrently the Bot Regen Accelerator can only be purchased through http://portal.qonqr.com. Go to the Depot and review your scope upgrades. The new QONQR Blue clients will allow for this purchase to be made in the app using your mobile billing. I don’t have a PayPal account -\tFor users interested in purchasing the Regen upgrade, but who do not have a PayPal account, PayPal does give you the option to checkout using your billing information without creating an account. PayPal is not allowed in my country, or I don’t have a credit or debit card -\tPlease contact support@QONQR.com for alternate options Is Bot Regen Accelerator counted as part of the 100% scope upgrades? -\tYes, but there is a bug that does not increase scope upgrade percent when you purchase this upgrade, that will be fixed in the coming days. For all other questions, please read the 7 blog posts prior to 7/29/2015 for information on what was included in the update today.\nBye Fack, its been a pleasure being allied and against you.\nThe two big issues that are both killing the game slowly and keeping it from growing exponentially are cube injustice and new player ramp. The game obviously also needs to provide a consistent and growing revenue stream as well. I think Silver needs to rethink how revenue is generated if he is going to address cube injustice and new player ramp. For revenue generation I would suggest a model that doesn't give a significant combat advantages. Download and play for free from level 0-99 Pay small monthly fee to get full functionality or play for free at 50% of offensive/defensive funtionality Still buy cubes, but cubes are used for following: - Credit Boost: harvest more credits for a period of time - Range Extension: ability to use standard attack/defense formations at extended ranges - Base Share: get 100% credit attainment even in bases owned by another faction - Purchase additional ordinance - Zone Name Change - ability to customize zone names. \"Breggland\" - Faction Change with Bots - pay for the ability to keep up to 50% of your bots with faction change - Experience Boost: %increase in experienced gained while leveling - Other: anything that helps grow a player or provides enjoyment, but doesn't tip the battle capability of a scope. New Player Ramp/Integration into Game - Offer paid immediate ramp package: one price to become 100 with full upgrades - Like the changes in Blue - Create new zones in Metro areas that only 0-99 level can launch into, with statewide ranges Understand that catering to those who have money and like to use it for an advantage is a good business model and for those people it might be ok to offer very expensive options: - Shield generators: temporary energy shield that adds X% increase to defense or stops X% of damage - EMP's: turns Absorbs off for X minutes. Does not destroy, just turns off - Chain Lighting: Does damage across multiple players in a zone From a development standpoint I have no idea what is possible, easy or hard, but the general idea is to make the playing field more fair for the standard player while maintaining and growing a business revenue stream.\nYou need to come to the Northeast US.

{"input": "What are the datasets used in this community for research?", "context": "\\section{Introduction}\nUnderwater robot picking is to use the robot to automatically capture sea creatures like holothurian, echinus, scallop, or starfish in an open-sea farm where underwater object detection is the key technology for locating creatures. Until now, the datasets used in this community are released by the Underwater Robot Professional Contest (URPC$\\protect\\footnote{Underwater Robot Professional Contest: {\\bf http://en.cnurpc.org}.}$) beginning from 2017, in which URPC2017 and URPC2018 are most often used for research. Unfortunately, as the information listed in Table \\ref{Info}, URPC series datasets do not provide the annotation file of the test set and cannot be downloaded after the contest. \nTherefore, researchers \\cite{2020arXiv200511552C,2019arXiv191103029L} first have to divide the training data into two subsets, including a new subset of training data and a new subset of testing data, and then train their proposed method and other \\emph{SOTA} methods. On the one hand, training other methods results in a significant increase in workload. On the other hand, different researchers divide different datasets in different ways, \n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\renewcommand\\tabcolsep{3.5pt}\n\\caption{Information about all the collected datasets. * denotes the test set's annotations are not available. \\emph{3} in Class means three types of creatures are labeled, \\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, and scallop. \\emph{4} means four types of creatures are labeled (starfish added).

URPC2017 only retains 15\\% images after removing similar images compared to other datasets. Thus the detector trained on URPC2017 is easy to overfit and cannot reflect the real performance.\nFor other URPC datasets, the latter also includes images from the former, \\emph{e.g.}, URPC2019 adds 2,000 new images compared to URPC2018; compared with URPC2019, URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ adds 800 new images. The URPC2020$_{DL}$ adds 1,000 new images compared to the URPC2020$_{ZJ}$. It is worth mentioning that the annotation of all datasets is incomplete; some datasets lack the starfish labels and it is easy to find error or missing labels. \\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ZhangBHRV17} pointed out that although the CNN model has a strong fitting ability for any dataset, the existence of dirty data will significantly weaken its robustness.\nTherefore, a reasonable dataset (containing a small number of similar images as well as an accurate annotation) and a corresponding recognized benchmark are urgently needed to promote community development.\n\n\nTo address these issues, we introduce a dataset called Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO) by collecting and re-annotating all the available underwater datasets. It contains 7,782 underwater images after deleting overly similar images and has a more accurate annotation with four types of classes (\\emph{i.e.,} holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish). \nBesides, based on the MMDetection$\\protect\\footnote{MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. {\\bf https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection}}$ \\cite{chen2019mmdetection} framework, we also provide a \\emph{SOTA} detector benchmark containing efficiency and accuracy indicators, providing a reference for both academic research and industrial applications. It is worth noting that JETSON AGX XAVIER$\\protect\\footnote{JETSON AGX XAVIER is an embedded development board produced by NVIDIA which could be deployed in an underwater robot. Please refer {\\bf https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-xavier-developer-kit} for more information.}$ was used to assess all the detectors in the efficiency test in order to simulate robot-embedded environment. DUO will be released in https://github.com/chongweiliu soon.\n\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper can be listed as follows.\n\n  $\\bullet$ By collecting and re-annotating all relevant datasets, we introduce a dataset called DUO with more reasonable annotations as well as a variety of underwater scenes.\n\n  $\\bullet$ We provide a corresponding benchmark of \\emph{SOTA} detectors on DUO including efficiency and accuracy indicators which could be a reference for both academic research and industrial applications. \n\n\n\\pagestyle{empty}\n\\section{Background}\nIn the year of 2017, underwater object detection for open-sea farming is first proposed in the target recognition track of Underwater Robot Picking Contest 2017$\\protect\\footnote{From 2020, the name has been changed into Underwater Robot Professional Contest which is also short for URPC.}$ (URPC2017) which aims to promote the development of theory, technology, and industry of the underwater agile robot and fill the blank of the grabbing task of the underwater agile robot. The competition sets up a target recognition track, a fixed-point grasping track, and an autonomous grasping track. The target recognition track concentrates on finding the {\\bf high accuracy and efficiency} algorithm which could be used in an underwater robot for automatically grasping.\n\nThe datasets we used to generate the DUO are listed below. The detailed information has been shown in Table \\ref{Info}.\n\n  {\\bf URPC2017}: It contains 17,655 images for training and 985 images for testing and the resolution of all the images is 720$\\times$405. All the images are taken from 6 videos at an interval of 10 frames. However, all the videos were filmed in an artificial simulated environment and pictures from the same video look almost identical. \n  \n   {\\bf URPC2018}: It contains 2,901 images for training and 800 images for testing and the resolutions of the images are 586$\\times$480, 704$\\times$576, 720$\\times$405, and 1,920$\\times$1,080. The test set's annotations are not available. Besides, some images were also collected from an artificial underwater environment.\n  \n  {\\bf URPC2019}: It contains 4,757 images for training and 1029 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\\times$2,160 captured by a GOPro camera. The test set's annotations are also not available and it contains images from the former contests.\n  \n  {\\bf URPC2020$_{ZJ}$}: From 2020, the URPC will be held twice a year. It was held first in Zhanjiang, China, in April and then in Dalian, China, in August. URPC2020$_{ZJ}$ means the dataset released in the first URPC2020 and URPC2020$_{DL}$ means the dataset released in the second URPC2020. This dataset contains 5,543 images for training and 2,000 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\\times$2,160. The test set's annotations are also not available.\n  \n  {\\bf URPC2020$_{DL}$}: This dataset contains 6,575 images for training and 2,400 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\\times$2,160. The test set's annotations are also not available.\n  \n  {\\bf UDD \\cite{2020arXiv200301446W}}: This dataset contains 1,827 images for training and 400 images for testing and the highest resolution of the images is 3,840$\\times$2,160. All the images are captured by a diver and a robot in a real open-sea farm.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{pie.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n   \\caption{The proportion distribution of the objects in DUO.}\n\\label{pie}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\centering\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[width=3.45in]{imagesize.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[width=3.45in]{numInstance.pdf}}\n  \\caption{(a) The distribution of instance sizes for DUO; (b) The number of categories per image.}\n  \\label{sum}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\section{Proposed Dataset}\n\n\\subsection{Image Deduplicating}\nAs we explained in Section 1, there are a large number of similar or repeated images in the series of URPC datasets. Therefore, it is important to delete duplicate or overly similar images and keep a variety of underwater scenarios when we merge these datasets together. Here we employ the Perceptual Hash algorithm (PHash) to remove those images. PHash has the special property that the hash value is dependent on the image content, and it remains approximately the same if the content is not significantly modified. Thus we can easily distinguish different scenarios and delete duplicate images within one scenario. \n\nAfter deduplicating, we obtain 7,782 images (6,671 images for training; 1,111 for testing). The retention rate of the new dataset is 95\\%, which means that there are only a few similar images in the new dataset. Figure \\ref{exam} shows that our dataset also retains various underwater scenes.\n\n\\subsection{Image Re-annotation}\nDue to the small size of objects and the blur underwater environment, there are always missing or wrong labels in the existing annotation files. In addition, some test sets' annotation files are not available and some datasets do not have the starfish annotation. In order to address these issues, we follow the next process which combines a CNN model and manual annotation to re-annotate these images. Specifically, we first train a detector (\\emph{i.e.,} GFL \\cite{li2020generalized}) with the originally labeled images. After that, the trained detector predicts all the 7,782 images. We treat the prediction as the groundtruth and use it to train the GFL again. We get the final GFL prediction called {\\bf the coarse annotation}. Next, we use manual correction to get the final annotation called {\\bf the fine annotation}. Notably, we adopt the COCO \\cite{Belongie2014} annotation form as the final format.\n\\subsection{Dataset Statistics}\n{\\bf The proportion of classes}: The total number of objects is 74,515. Holothurian, echinus, scallop, and starfish are 7,887, 50,156, 1,924, and 14,548, respectively. Figure \\ref{pie} shows the proportion of each creatures where echinus accounts for 67.3\\% of the total. The whole data distribution shows an obvious long-tail distribution because the different economic benefits of different seafoods determine the different breed quantities.\n\n{\\bf The distribution of instance sizes}: Figure \\ref{sum}(a) shows an instance size distribution of DUO. \\emph{Percent of image size} represents the ratio of object area to image area, and \\emph{Percent of instance} represents the ratio of the corresponding number of objects to the total number of objects. Because of these small creatures and high-resolution images, the vast majority of objects occupy 0.3\\% to 1.5\\% of the image area.\n\n{\\bf The instance number per image}: Figure \\ref{sum}(b) illustrates the number of categories per image for DUO. \\emph{Number of instances} represents the number of objects one image has, and \\emph{ Percentage of images} represents the ratio of the corresponding number of images to the total number of images. Most images contain between 5 and 15 instances, with an average of 9.57 instances per image.\n\n{\\bf Summary}:\nIn general, smaller objects are harder to detect. For PASCAL VOC \\cite{Everingham2007The} or COCO \\cite{Belongie2014}, roughly 50\\% of all objects occupy no more than 10\\% of the image itself, and others evenly occupy from 10\\% to 100\\%. \nIn the aspect of instances number per image, COCO contains 7.7 instances per image and VOC contains 3. In comparison, DUO has 9.57 instances per image and most instances less than 1.5\\% of the image size.\nTherefore, DUO contains almost exclusively massive small instances and has the long-tail distribution at the same time, which means it is promising to design a detector to deal with massive small objects and stay high efficiency at the same time for underwater robot picking.\n\n\\section{Benchmark}\nBecause the aim of underwater object detection for robot picking is to find {\\bf the high accuracy and efficiency} algorithm, we consider both the accuracy and efficiency evaluations in the benchmark as shown in Table \\ref{ben}.\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\nHere we adopt the standard COCO metrics (mean average precision, \\emph{i.e.,} mAP) for the accuracy evaluation and also provide the mAP of each class due to the long-tail distribution.\n\n{\\bf AP} -- mAP at IoU=0.50:0.05:0.95.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{50}$} --  mAP at IoU=0.50.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{75}$} --  mAP at IoU=0.75. \n\n{\\bf AP$_{S}$} --   {\\bf AP} for small objects of area smaller than 32$^{2}$.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{M}$} --   {\\bf AP} for objects of area between 32$^{2}$ and 96$^{2}$.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{L}$} --   {\\bf AP} for large objects of area bigger than 96$^{2}$.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{Ho}$} --  {\\bf AP} in holothurian.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{Ec}$} --  {\\bf AP} in echinus.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{Sc}$} --  {\\bf AP} in scallop.\n\n{\\bf AP$_{St}$} --  {\\bf AP} in starfish.\n\n\nFor the efficiency evaluation, we provide three metrics:\n\n{\\bf Param.} --  The parameters of a detector.\n\n{\\bf FLOPs} --  Floating-point operations per second.\n\n{\\bf FPS} --  Frames per second.\n\nNotably, {\\bf FLOPs} is calculated under the 512$\\times$512 input image size and {\\bf FPS} is tested on a JETSON AGX XAVIER under MODE$\\_$30W$\\_$ALL. \n\n\\subsection{Standard Training Configuration}\nWe follow a widely used open-source toolbox, \\emph{i.e.,} MMDetection (V2.5.0) to produce up our benchmark. During the training, the standard configurations are as follows:\n\n  $\\bullet$ We initialize the backbone models (\\emph{e.g.,} ResNet50) with pre-trained parameters on ImageNet \\cite{Deng2009ImageNet}.\n\n  $\\bullet$ We resize each image into 512 $\\times$ 512 pixels both in training and testing. Each image is flipped horizontally with 0.5 probability during training.\n\n  $\\bullet$ We normalize RGB channels by subtracting 123.675, 116.28, 103.53 and dividing by 58.395, 57.12, 57.375, respectively.\n\n  $\\bullet$ SGD method is adopted to optimize the model. The initial learning rate is set to be 0.005 in a single GTX 1080Ti with batchsize 4 and is decreased by 0.1 at the 8th and 11th epoch, respectively. WarmUp \\cite{2019arXiv190307071L} is also employed in the first 500 iterations. Totally there are 12 training epochs.\n\n  $\\bullet$ Testing time augmentation (\\emph{i.e.,} flipping test or multi-scale testing) is not employed.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Benchmark Analysis}\nTable \\ref{ben} shows the benchmark for the \\emph{SOTA} methods. Multi- and one- stage detectors with three kinds of backbones (\\emph{i.e.,} ResNet18, 50, 101) give a comprehensive assessment on DUO. We also deploy all the methods to AGX to assess efficiency.\n\nIn general, the multi-stage (Cascade R-CNN) detectors have high accuracy and low efficiency, while the one-stage (RetinaNet) detectors have low accuracy and high efficiency.

{"input": "What is the attention module pretrained on?", "context": "Introduction\nSpeech-to-Text translation (ST) is essential for a wide range of scenarios: for example in emergency calls, where agents have to respond emergent requests in a foreign language BIBREF0; or in online courses, where audiences and speakers use different languages BIBREF1. To tackle this problem, existing approaches can be categorized into cascaded method BIBREF2, BIBREF3, where a machine translation (MT) model translates outputs of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system into target language, and end-to-end method BIBREF4, BIBREF5, where a single model learns acoustic frames to target word sequence mappings in one step towards the final objective of interest. Although the cascaded model remains the dominant approach due to its better performance, the end-to-end method becomes more and more popular because it has lower latency by avoiding inferences with two models and rectifies the error propagation in theory.\nSince it is hard to obtain a large-scale ST dataset, multi-task learning BIBREF5, BIBREF6 and pre-training techniques BIBREF7 have been applied to end-to-end ST model to leverage large-scale datasets of ASR and MT. A common practice is to pre-train two encoder-decoder models for ASR and MT respectively, and then initialize the ST model with the encoder of the ASR model and the decoder of the MT model. Subsequently, the ST model is optimized with the multi-task learning by weighing the losses of ASR, MT, and ST. This approach, however, causes a huge gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, which are summarized into three folds:\nSubnet Waste: The ST system just reuses the ASR encoder and the MT decoder, while discards other pre-trained subnets, such as the MT encoder. Consequently, valuable semantic information captured by the MT encoder cannot be inherited by the final ST system.\nRole Mismatch: The speech encoder plays different roles in pre-training and fine-tuning. The encoder is a pure acoustic model in pre-training, while it has to extract semantic and linguistic features additionally in fine-tuning, which significantly increases the learning difficulty.\nNon-pre-trained Attention Module: Previous work BIBREF6 trains attention modules for ASR, MT and ST respectively, hence, the attention module of ST does not benefit from the pre-training.\nTo address these issues, we propose a Tandem Connectionist Encoding Network (TCEN), which is able to reuse all subnets in pre-training, keep the roles of subnets consistent, and pre-train the attention module. Concretely, the TCEN consists of three components, a speech encoder, a text encoder, and a target text decoder. Different from the previous work that pre-trains an encoder-decoder based ASR model, we only pre-train an ASR encoder by optimizing the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) BIBREF8 objective function. In this way, the additional decoder of ASR is not required while keeping the ability to read acoustic features into the source language space by the speech encoder. Besides, the text encoder and decoder can be pre-trained on a large MT dataset. After that, we employ common used multi-task learning method to jointly learn ASR, MT and ST tasks.\nCompared to prior works, the encoder of TCEN is a concatenation of an ASR encoder and an MT encoder and our model does not have an ASR decoder, so the subnet waste issue is solved. Furthermore, the two encoders work at tandem, disentangling acoustic feature extraction and linguistic feature extraction, ensuring the role consistency between pre-training and fine-tuning. Moreover, we reuse the pre-trained MT attention module in ST, so we can leverage the alignment information learned in pre-training.\nSince the text encoder consumes word embeddings of plausible texts in MT task but uses speech encoder outputs in ST task, another question is how one guarantees the speech encoder outputs are consistent with the word embeddings. We further modify our model to achieve semantic consistency and length consistency. Specifically, (1) the projection matrix at the CTC classification layer for ASR is shared with the word embedding matrix, ensuring that they are mapped to the same latent space, and (2) the length of the speech encoder output is proportional to the length of the input frame, so it is much longer than a natural sentence. To bridge the length gap, source sentences in MT are lengthened by adding word repetitions and blank tokens to mimic the CTC output sequences.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on the IWSLT18 speech translation benchmark BIBREF1, demonstrating the effectiveness of each component. Our model is significantly better than previous methods by 3.6 and 2.2 BLEU scores for the subword-level decoding and character-level decoding strategies, respectively.\nOur contributions are three-folds: 1) we shed light on why previous ST models cannot sufficiently utilize the knowledge learned from the pre-training process; 2) we propose a new ST model, which alleviates shortcomings in existing methods; and 3) we empirically evaluate the proposed model on a large-scale public dataset.\nBackground ::: Problem Formulation\nEnd-to-end speech translation aims to translate a piece of audio into a target-language translation in one step. The raw speech signals are usually converted to sequences of acoustic features, e.g. Mel filterbank features. Here, we define the speech feature sequence as $\\mathbf {x} = (x_1, \\cdots , x_{T_x})$.The transcription and translation sequences are denoted as $\\mathbf {y^{s}} = (y_1^{s}, \\cdots , y_{T_s}^{s})$, and $\\mathbf {y^{t}} = (y_1^{t}, \\cdots , y_{T_t}^{t})$ repectively. Each symbol in $\\mathbf {y^{s}}$ or $\\mathbf {y^{t}}$ is an integer index of the symbol in a vocabulary $V_{src}$ or $V_{trg}$ respectively (e.g. $y^s_i=k, k\\in [0, |V_{src}|-1]$). In this work, we suppose that an ASR dataset, an MT dataset, and a ST dataset are available, denoted as $\\mathcal {A} = \\lbrace (\\mathbf {x_i}, \\mathbf {y^{s}_i})\\rbrace _{i=0}^I$, $\\mathcal {M} =\\lbrace (\\mathbf {y^{s}_j}, \\mathbf {y^{t}_j})\\rbrace _{j=0}^J$ and $ \\mathcal {S} =\\lbrace (\\mathbf {x_l}, \\mathbf {y^{t}_l})\\rbrace _{l=0}^L$ respectively. Given a new piece of audio $\\mathbf {x}$, our goal is to learn an end to end model to generate a translation sentence $\\mathbf {y^{t}}$ without generating an intermediate result $\\mathbf {y^{s}}$.\nBackground ::: Multi-Task Learning and Pre-training for ST\nTo leverage large scale ASR and MT data, multi-task learning and pre-training techniques are widely employed to improve the ST system. As shown in Figure FIGREF4, there are three popular multi-task strategies for ST, including 1) one-to-many setting, in which a speech encoder is shared between ASR and ST tasks; 2) many-to-one setting in which a decoder is shared between MT and ST tasks; and 3) many-to-many setting where both the encoder and decoder are shared.\nA many-to-many multi-task model contains two encoders as well as two decoders. It can be jointly trained on ASR, MT, and ST tasks. As the attention module is task-specific, three attentions are defined.\nUsually, the size of $\\mathcal {A}$ and $\\mathcal {M}$ is much larger than $\\mathcal {S}$. Therefore, the common training practice is to pre-train the model on ASR and MT tasks and then fine-tune it with a multi-task learning manner. However, as aforementioned, this method suffers from subnet waste, role mismatch and non-pre-trained attention issues, which severely limits the end-to-end ST performance.\nOur method\nIn this section, we first introduce the architecture of TCEN, which consists of two encoders connected in tandem, and one decoder with an attention module. Then we give the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy for TCEN. Finally, we propose our solutions for semantic and length inconsistency problems, which are caused by multi-task learning.\nOur method ::: TCEN Architecture\nFigure FIGREF5 sketches the overall architecture of TCEN, including a speech encoder $enc_s$, a text encoder $enc_t$ and a decoder $dec$ with an attention module $att$. During training, the $enc_s$ acts like an acoustic model which reads the input $\\mathbf {x}$ to word or subword representations $\\mathbf {h^s}$, then $enc_t$ learns high-level linguistic knowledge into hidden representations $\\mathbf {h^t}$. Finally, the $dec$ defines a distribution probability over target words. The advantage of our architecture is that two encoders disentangle acoustic feature extraction and linguistic feature extraction, making sure that valuable knowledge learned from ASR and MT tasks can be effectively leveraged for ST training. Besides, every module in pre-training can be utilized in fine-tuning, alleviating the subnet waste problem.\nFollow BIBREF9 inaguma2018speech, we use CNN-BiLSTM architecture to build our model. Specifically, the input features $\\mathbf {x}$ are organized as a sequence of feature vectors in length $T_x$. Then, $\\mathbf {x}$ is passed into a stack of two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling:\nwhere $\\mathbf {v}^{(l-1)}$ is feature maps in last layer and $\\mathbf {W}^{(l)}$ is the filter. The max-pooling layers downsample the sequence in length by a total factor of four. The down-sampled feature sequence is further fed into a stack of five bidirectional $d$-dimensional LSTM layers:\nwhere $[;]$ denotes the vector concatenation. The final output representation from the speech encoder is denoted as $\\mathbf {h^s}=(h^s_1, \\cdots , h^s_{\\frac{T_x}{4}})$, where $h_i^s \\in \\mathbb {R}^d$.\nThe text encoder $enc_t$ consists of two bidirectional LSTM layers. In ST task, $enc_t$ accepts speech encoder output $\\mathbf {h}^s$ as input. While in MT, $enc_t$ consumes the word embedding representation $\\mathbf {e^s}$ derived from $\\mathbf {y^s}$, where each element $e^s_i$ is computed by choosing the $y_i^s$-th vector from the source embedding matrix $W_{E^s}$. The goal of $enc_t$ is to extract high-level linguistic features like syntactic features or semantic features from lower level subword representations $\\mathbf {h}^s$ or $\\mathbf {e}^s$. Since $\\mathbf {h}^s$ and $\\mathbf {e}^s$ belong to different latent space and have different lengths, there remain semantic and length inconsistency problems. We will provide our solutions in Section SECREF21. The output sequence of $enc_t$ is denoted as $\\mathbf {h}^t$.\nThe decoder is defined as two unidirectional LSTM layers with an additive attention $att$. It predicts target sequence $\\mathbf {y^{t}}$ by estimating conditional probability $P(\\mathbf {y^{t}}|\\mathbf {x})$:\nHere, $z_k$ is the the hidden state of the deocder RNN at $k$ step and $c_k$ is a time-dependent context vector computed by the attention $att$.\nOur method ::: Training Procedure\nFollowing previous work, we split the training procedure to pre-training and fine-tuning stages. In pre-training stage, the speech encoder $enc_s$ is trained towards CTC objective using dataset $\\mathcal {A}$, while the text encoder $enc_t$ and the decoder $dec$ are trained on MT dataset $\\mathcal {M}$. In fine-tuning stage, we jointly train the model on ASR, MT, and ST tasks.\nOur method ::: Training Procedure ::: Pre-training\nTo sufficiently utilize the large dataset $\\mathcal {A}$ and $\\mathcal {M}$, the model is pre-trained on CTC-based ASR task and MT task in the pre-training stage.\nFor ASR task, in order to get rid of the requirement for decoder and enable the $enc_s$ to generate subword representation, we leverage connectionist temporal classification (CTC) BIBREF8 loss to train the speech encoder.\nGiven an input $\\mathbf {x}$, $enc_s$ emits a sequence of hidden vectors $\\mathbf {h^s}$, then a softmax classification layer predicts a CTC path $\\mathbf {\\pi }$, where $\\pi _t \\in V_{src} \\cup $ {`-'} is the observing label at particular RNN step $t$, and `-' is the blank token representing no observed labels:\nwhere $W_{ctc} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d \\times (|V_{src}|+1)}$ is the weight matrix in the classification layer and $T$ is the total length of encoder RNN.\nA legal CTC path $\\mathbf {\\pi }$ is a variation of the source transcription $\\mathbf {y}^s$ by allowing occurrences of blank tokens and repetitions, as shown in Table TABREF14. For each transcription $\\mathbf {y}$, there exist many legal CTC paths in length $T$. The CTC objective trains the model to maximize the probability of observing the golden sequence $\\mathbf {y}^s$, which is calculated by summing the probabilities of all possible legal paths:\nwhere $\\Phi _T(y)$ is the set of all legal CTC paths for sequence $\\mathbf {y}$ with length $T$. The loss can be easily computed using forward-backward algorithm. More details about CTC are provided in supplementary material.\nFor MT task, we use the cross-entropy loss as the training objective. During training, $\\mathbf {y^s}$ is converted to embedding vectors $\\mathbf {e^s}$ through embedding layer $W_{E^s}$, then $enc_t$ consumes $\\mathbf {e^s}$ and pass the output $\\mathbf {h^t}$ to decoder. The objective function is defined as:\nOur method ::: Training Procedure ::: Fine-tune\nIn fine-tune stage, we jointly update the model on ASR, MT, and ST tasks. The training for ASR and MT follows the same process as it was in pre-training stage.\nFor ST task, the $enc_s$ reads the input $\\mathbf {x}$ and generates $\\mathbf {h^s}$, then $enc_t$ learns high-level linguistic knowledge into $\\mathbf {h^t}$. Finally, the $dec$ predicts the target sentence. The ST loss function is defined as:\nFollowing the update strategy proposed by BIBREF11 luong2015multi, we allocate a different training ratio $\\alpha _i$ for each task. When switching between tasks, we select randomly a new task $i$ with probability $\\frac{\\alpha _i}{\\sum _{j}\\alpha _{j}}$.\nOur method ::: Subnet-Consistency\nOur model keeps role consistency between pre-training and fine-tuning by connecting two encoders for ST task. However, this leads to some new problems: 1) The text encoder consumes $\\mathbf {e^s}$ during MT training, while it accepts $\\mathbf {h^s}$ during ST training. However, $\\mathbf {e^s}$ and $\\mathbf {h^s}$ may not follow the same distribution, resulting in the semantic inconsistency. 2) Besides, the length of $\\mathbf {h^s}$ is not the same order of magnitude with the length of $\\mathbf {e^s}$, resulting in the length inconsistency.\nIn response to the above two challenges, we propose two countermeasures: 1) We share weights between CTC classification layer and source-end word embedding layer during training of ASR and MT, encouraging $\\mathbf {e^s}$ and $\\mathbf {h^s}$ in the same space. 2)We feed the text encoder source sentences in the format of CTC path, which are generated from a seq2seq model, making it more robust toward long inputs.\nOur method ::: Subnet-Consistency ::: Semantic Consistency\nAs shown in Figure FIGREF5, during multi-task training, two different hidden features will be fed into the text encoder $enc_t$: the embedding representation $\\mathbf {e}^s$ in MT task, and the $enc_s$ output $\\mathbf {h^s}$ in ST task. Without any regularization, they may belong to different latent spaces. Due to the space gap, the $enc_t$ has to compromise between two tasks, limiting its performance on individual tasks.\nTo bridge the space gap, our idea is to pull $\\mathbf {h^s}$ into the latent space where $\\mathbf {e}^s$ belong. Specifically, we share the weight $W_{ctc}$ in CTC classification layer with the source embedding weights $W_{E^s}$, which means $W_{ctc} = W_{E^s}$. In this way, when predicting the CTC path $\\mathbf {\\pi }$, the probability of observing the particular label $w_i \\in V_{src}\\cup ${`-'} at time step $t$, $p(\\pi _t=w_i|\\mathbf {x})$, is computed by normalizing the product of hidden vector $h_t^s$ and the $i$-th vector in $W_{E^s}$:\nThe loss function closes the distance between $h^s_t$ and golden embedding vector, encouraging $\\mathbf {h}^s$ have the same distribution with $\\mathbf {e}^s$.\nOur method ::: Subnet-Consistency ::: Length Consistency\nAnother existing problem is length inconsistency. The length of the sequence $\\mathbf {h^s}$ is proportional to the length of the input frame $\\mathbf {x}$, which is much longer than the length of $\\mathbf {e^s}$. To solve this problem, we train an RNN-based seq2seq model to transform normal source sentences to noisy sentences in CTC path format, and replace standard MT with denoising MT for multi-tasking.\nSpecifically, we first train a CTC ASR model based on dataset $\\mathcal {A} = \\lbrace (\\mathbf {x}_i, \\mathbf {y}^s_i)\\rbrace _{i=0}^{I}$, and generate a CTC-path $\\mathbf {\\pi }_i$ for each audio $\\mathbf {x}_i$ by greedy decoding. Then we define an operation $S(\\cdot )$, which converts a CTC path $\\mathbf {\\pi }$ to a sequence of the unique tokens $\\mathbf {u}$ and a sequence of repetition times for each token $\\mathbf {l}$, denoted as $S(\\mathbf {\\pi }) = (\\mathbf {u}, \\mathbf {l})$. Notably, the operation is reversible, meaning that $S^{-1} (\\mathbf {u}, \\mathbf {l})=\\mathbf {\\pi }$. We use the example $\\mathbf {\\pi _1}$ in Table TABREF14 and show the corresponding $\\mathbf {u}$ and $\\mathbf {l}$ in Table TABREF24.\nThen we build a dataset $\\mathcal {P} = \\lbrace (\\mathbf {y^s}_i, \\mathbf {u}_i, \\mathbf {l}_i)\\rbrace _{i=0}^{I}$ by decoding all the audio pieces in $\\mathcal {A}$ and transform the resulting path by the operation $S(\\cdot )$. After that, we train a seq2seq model, as shown in Figure FIGREF25, which takes $ \\mathbf {y^s}_i$ as input and decodes $\\mathbf {u}_i, \\mathbf {l}_i$ as outputs. With the seq2seq model, a noisy MT dataset $\\mathcal {M}^{\\prime }=\\lbrace (\\mathbf {\\pi }_l, \\mathbf {y^t}_l)\\rbrace _{l=0}^{L}$ is obtained by converting every source sentence $\\mathbf {y^s}_i \\in \\mathcal {M}$ to $\\mathbf {\\pi _i}$, where $\\mathbf {\\pi }_i = S^{-1}(\\mathbf {u}_i, \\mathbf {l}_i)$. We did not use the standard seq2seq model which takes $\\mathbf {y^s}$ as input and generates $\\mathbf {\\pi }$ directly, since there are too many blank tokens `-' in $\\mathbf {\\pi }$ and the model tends to generate a long sequence with only blank tokens. During MT training, we randomly sample text pairs from $\\mathcal {M}^{\\prime }$ and $\\mathcal {M}$ according to a hyper-parameter $k$. After tuning on the validation set, about $30\\%$ pairs are sampled from $\\mathcal {M}^{\\prime }$. In this way, the $enc_t$ is more robust toward the longer inputs given by the $enc_s$.\nExperiments\nWe conduct experiments on the IWSLT18 speech translation task BIBREF1. Since IWSLT participators use different data pre-processing methods, we reproduce several competitive baselines based on the ESPnet BIBREF12 for a fair comparison.\nExperiments ::: Dataset ::: Speech translation data:\nThe organizer provides a speech translation corpus extracting from the TED talk (ST-TED), which consists of raw English wave files, English transcriptions, and aligned German translations. The corpus contains 272 hours of English speech with 171k segments. We split 2k segments from the corpus as dev set and tst2010, tst2013, tst2014, tst2015 are used as test sets.\nSpeech recognition data: Aside from ST-TED, TED-LIUM2 corpus BIBREF13 is provided as speech recognition data, which contains 207 hours of English speech and 93k transcript sentences.\nText translation data: We use transcription and translation pairs in the ST-TED corpus and WIT3 as in-domain MT data, which contains 130k and 200k sentence pairs respectively. WMT2018 is used as out-of-domain training data which consists of 41M sentence pairs.\nData preprocessing: For speech data, the utterances are segmented into multiple frames with a 25 ms window size and a 10 ms step size. Then we extract 80-channel log-Mel filter bank and 3-dimensional pitch features using Kaldi BIBREF14, resulting in 83-dimensional input features. We normalize them by the mean and the standard deviation on the whole training set. The utterances with more than 3000 frames are discarded. The transcripts in ST-TED are in true-case with punctuation while in TED-LIUM2, transcripts are in lower-case and unpunctuated. Thus, we lowercase all the sentences and remove the punctuation to keep consistent. To increase the amount of training data, we perform speed perturbation on the raw signals with speed factors 0.9 and 1.1. For the text translation data, sentences longer than 80 words or shorter than 10 words are removed. Besides, we discard pairs whose length ratio between source and target sentence is smaller than 0.5 or larger than 2.0. Word tokenization is performed using the Moses scripts and both English and German words are in lower-case.\nWe use two different sets of vocabulary for our experiments. For the subword experiments, both English and German vocabularies are generated using sentencepiece BIBREF15 with a fixed size of 5k tokens. BIBREF9 inaguma2018speech show that increasing the vocabulary size is not helpful for ST task. For the character experiments, both English and German sentences are represented in the character level.\nFor evaluation, we segment each audio with the LIUM SpkDiarization tool BIBREF16 and then perform MWER segmentation with RWTH toolkit BIBREF17. We use lowercase BLEU as evaluation metric.\nExperiments ::: Baseline Models and Implementation\nWe compare our method with following baselines.\nVanilla ST baseline: The vanilla ST BIBREF9 has only a speech encoder and a decoder. It is trained from scratch on the ST-TED corpus.\nPre-training baselines: We conduct three pre-training baseline experiments: 1) encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model; 2) decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model; and 3) encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained. The ASR model has the same architecture with vanilla ST model, trained on the mixture of ST-TED and TED-LIUM2 corpus. The MT model has a text encoder and decoder with the same architecture of which in TCEN. It is first trained on WMT data (out-of-domain) and then fine-tuned on in-domain data.\nMulti-task baselines: We also conduct three multi-task baseline experiments including one-to-many setting, many-to-one setting, and many-to-many setting. In the first two settings, we train the model with $\\alpha _{st}=0.75$ while $\\alpha _{asr}=0.25$ or $\\alpha _{mt}=0.25$. For many-to-many setting, we use $\\alpha _{st}=0.6, \\alpha _{asr}=0.2$ and $\\alpha _{mt}=0.2$.. For MT task, we use only in-domain data.\nMany-to-many+pre-training: We train a many-to-many multi-task model where the encoders and decoders are derived from pre-trained ASR and MT models. Triangle+pre-train: BIBREF18 DBLP:conf/naacl/AnastasopoulosC18 proposed a triangle multi-task strategy for speech translation. Their model solves the subnet waste issue by concatenating an ST decoder to an ASR encoder-decoder model. Notably, their ST decoder can consume representations from the speech encoder as well as the ASR decoder. For a fair comparison, the speech encoder and the ASR decoder are initialized from the pre-trained ASR model. The Triangle model is fine-tuned under their multi-task manner.\nAll our baselines as well as TCEN are implemented based on ESPnet BIBREF12, the RNN size is set as $d=1024$ for all models. We use a dropout of 0.3 for embeddings and encoders, and train using Adadelta with initial learning rate of 1.0 for a maximum of 10 epochs.\nFor training of TCEN, we set $\\alpha _{asr}=0.2$ and $\\alpha _{mt}=0.8$ in the pre-training stage, since the MT dataset is much larger than ASR dataset. For fine-tune, we use $\\alpha _{st}=0.6, \\alpha _{asr}=0.2$ and $\\alpha _{mt}=0.2$, same as the `many-to-many' baseline.\nFor testing, we select the model with the best accuracy on speech translation task on dev set. At inference time, we use a beam size of 10, and the beam scores include length normalization with a weight of 0.2.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Results\nTable TABREF29 shows the results on four test sets as well as the average performance. Our method significantly outperforms the strong `many-to-many+pretrain' baseline by 3.6 and 2.2 BLEU scores respectively, indicating the proposed method is very effective that substantially improves the translation quality. Besides, both pre-training and multi-task learning can improve translation quality, and the pre-training settings (2nd-4th rows) are more effective compared to multi-task settings (5th-8th rows). We observe a performance degradation in the `triangle+pretrain' baseline. Compared to our method, where the decoder receives higher-level syntactic and semantic linguistic knowledge extracted from text encoder, their ASR decoder can only provide lower word-level linguistic information. Besides, since their model lacks text encoder and the architecture of ST decoder is different from MT decoder, their model cannot utilize the large-scale MT data in all the training stages. Interestingly, we find that the char-level models outperform the subword-level models in all settings, especially in vanilla baseline. A similar phenomenon is observed by BIBREF6 berard2018end. A possible explanation is that learning the alignments between speech frames and subword units in another language is notoriously difficult. Our method can bring more gains in the subword setting since our model is good at learning the text-to-text alignment and the subword-level alignment is more helpful to the translation quality.\nExperiments ::: Discussion ::: Ablation Study\nTo better understand the contribution of each component, we perform an ablation study on subword-level experiments. The results are shown in Table TABREF37. In `-MT noise' setting, we do not add noise to source sentences for MT. In `-weight sharing' setting, we use different parameters in CTC classification layer and source embedding layer. These two experiments prove that both weight sharing and using noisy MT input benefit to the final translation quality. Performance degrades more in `-weight sharing', indicating the semantic consistency contributes more to our model. In the `-pretrain' experiment, we remove the pre-training stage and directly update the model on three tasks, leading to a dramatic decrease on BLEU score, indicating the pre-training is an indispensable step for end-to-end ST.\nExperiments ::: Discussion ::: Learning Curve\nIt is interesting to investigate why our method is superior to baselines. We find that TCEN achieves a higher final result owing to a better start-point in fine-tuning. Figure FIGREF39 provides learning curves of subword accuracy on validation set. The x-axis denotes the fine-tuning training steps. The vanilla model starts at a low accuracy, because its networks are not pre-trained on the ASR and MT data. The trends of our model and `many-to-many+pretrain' are similar, but our model outperforms it about five points in the whole fine-tuning process. It indicates that the gain comes from bridging the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning rather than a better fine-tuning process.\nExperiments ::: Discussion ::: Compared with a Cascaded System\nTable TABREF29 compares our model with end-to-end baselines. Here, we compare our model with cascaded systems. We build a cascaded system by combining the ASR model and MT model used in pre-training baseline. Word error rate (WER) of the ASR system and BLEU score of the MT system are reported in the supplementary material. In addition to a simple combination of the ASR and MT systems, we also re-segment the ASR outputs before feeding to the MT system, denoted as cascaded+re-seg. Specifically, we train a seq2seq model BIBREF19 on the MT dataset, where the source side is a no punctuation sentence and the target side is a natural sentence. After that, we use the seq2seq model to add sentence boundaries and punctuation on ASR outputs. Experimental results are shown in Table TABREF41. Our end-to-end model outperforms the simple cascaded model over 2 BLEU scores, and it achieves a comparable performance with the cascaded model combining with a sentence re-segment model.\nRelated Work\nEarly works conduct speech translation in a pipeline manner BIBREF2, BIBREF20, where the ASR output lattices are fed into an MT system to generate target sentences. HMM BIBREF21, DenseNet BIBREF22, TDNN BIBREF23 are commonly used ASR systems, while RNN with attention BIBREF19 and Transformer BIBREF10 are top choices for MT. To enhance the robustness of the NMT model towards ASR errors, BIBREF24 DBLP:conf/eacl/TsvetkovMD14 and BIBREF25 DBLP:conf/asru/ChenHHL17 propose to simulate the noise in training and inference.\nTo avoid error propagation and high latency issues, recent works propose translating the acoustic speech into text in target language without yielding the source transcription BIBREF4. Since ST data is scarce, pre-training BIBREF7, multi-task learning BIBREF4, BIBREF6, curriculum learning BIBREF26, attention-passing BIBREF27, and knowledge distillation BIBREF28, BIBREF29 strategies have been explored to utilize ASR data and MT data. Specifically, BIBREF5 DBLP:conf/interspeech/WeissCJWC17 show improvements of performance by training the ST model jointly with the ASR and the MT model. BIBREF6 berard2018end observe faster convergence and better results due to pre-training and multi-task learning on a larger dataset. BIBREF7 DBLP:conf/naacl/BansalKLLG19 show that pre-training a speech encoder on one language can improve ST quality on a different source language. All of them follow the traditional multi-task training strategies. BIBREF26 DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1802-06003 propose to use curriculum learning to improve ST performance on syntactically distant language pairs. To effectively leverage transcriptions in ST data, BIBREF18 DBLP:conf/naacl/AnastasopoulosC18 augment the multi-task model where the target decoder receives information from the source decoder and they show improvements on low-resource speech translation. Their model just consumes ASR and ST data, in contrast, our work sufficiently utilizes the large-scale MT data to capture the rich semantic knowledge. BIBREF30 DBLP:conf/icassp/JiaJMWCCALW19 use pre-trained MT and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models to convert weakly supervised data into ST pairs and demonstrate that an end-to-end MT model can be trained using only synthesised data.\nConclusion\nThis paper has investigated the end-to-end method for ST. It has discussed why there is a huge gap between pre-training and fine-tuning in previous methods. To alleviate these issues, we have proposed a method, which is capable of reusing every sub-net and keeping the role of sub-net consistent between pre-training and fine-tuning.

{"input": "What tasks are used for evaluation?", "context": "Introduction\nThe Transformer architecture BIBREF0 for deep neural networks has quickly risen to prominence in NLP through its efficiency and performance, leading to improvements in the state of the art of Neural Machine Translation BIBREF1, BIBREF2, as well as inspiring other powerful general-purpose models like BERT BIBREF3 and GPT-2 BIBREF4. At the heart of the Transformer lie multi-head attention mechanisms: each word is represented by multiple different weighted averages of its relevant context. As suggested by recent works on interpreting attention head roles, separate attention heads may learn to look for various relationships between tokens BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9.\nThe attention distribution of each head is predicted typically using the softmax normalizing transform. As a result, all context words have non-zero attention weight. Recent work on single attention architectures suggest that using sparse normalizing transforms in attention mechanisms such as sparsemax – which can yield exactly zero probabilities for irrelevant words – may improve performance and interpretability BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14. Qualitative analysis of attention heads BIBREF0 suggests that, depending on what phenomena they capture, heads tend to favor flatter or more peaked distributions.\nRecent works have proposed sparse Transformers BIBREF10 and adaptive span Transformers BIBREF11. However, the “sparsity\" of those models only limits the attention to a contiguous span of past tokens, while in this work we propose a highly adaptive Transformer model that is capable of attending to a sparse set of words that are not necessarily contiguous. Figure FIGREF1 shows the relationship of these methods with ours.\nOur contributions are the following:\nWe introduce sparse attention into the Transformer architecture, showing that it eases interpretability and leads to slight accuracy gains.\nWe propose an adaptive version of sparse attention, where the shape of each attention head is learnable and can vary continuously and dynamically between the dense limit case of softmax and the sparse, piecewise-linear sparsemax case.\nWe make an extensive analysis of the added interpretability of these models, identifying both crisper examples of attention head behavior observed in previous work, as well as novel behaviors unraveled thanks to the sparsity and adaptivity of our proposed model.\nBackground ::: The Transformer\nIn NMT, the Transformer BIBREF0 is a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model which maps an input sequence to an output sequence through hierarchical multi-head attention mechanisms, yielding a dynamic, context-dependent strategy for propagating information within and across sentences. It contrasts with previous seq2seq models, which usually rely either on costly gated recurrent operations BIBREF15, BIBREF16 or static convolutions BIBREF17.\nGiven $n$ query contexts and $m$ sequence items under consideration, attention mechanisms compute, for each query, a weighted representation of the items. The particular attention mechanism used in BIBREF0 is called scaled dot-product attention, and it is computed in the following way:\nwhere $\\mathbf {Q} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{n \\times d}$ contains representations of the queries, $\\mathbf {K}, \\mathbf {V} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m \\times d}$ are the keys and values of the items attended over, and $d$ is the dimensionality of these representations. The $\\mathbf {\\pi }$ mapping normalizes row-wise using softmax, $\\mathbf {\\pi }(\\mathbf {Z})_{ij} = \\operatornamewithlimits{\\mathsf {softmax}}(\\mathbf {z}_i)_j$, where\nIn words, the keys are used to compute a relevance score between each item and query. Then, normalized attention weights are computed using softmax, and these are used to weight the values of each item at each query context.\nHowever, for complex tasks, different parts of a sequence may be relevant in different ways, motivating multi-head attention in Transformers. This is simply the application of Equation DISPLAY_FORM7 in parallel $H$ times, each with a different, learned linear transformation that allows specialization:\nIn the Transformer, there are three separate multi-head attention mechanisms for distinct purposes:\nEncoder self-attention: builds rich, layered representations of each input word, by attending on the entire input sentence.\nContext attention: selects a representative weighted average of the encodings of the input words, at each time step of the decoder.\nDecoder self-attention: attends over the partial output sentence fragment produced so far.\nTogether, these mechanisms enable the contextualized flow of information between the input sentence and the sequential decoder.\nBackground ::: Sparse Attention\nThe softmax mapping (Equation DISPLAY_FORM8) is elementwise proportional to $\\exp $, therefore it can never assign a weight of exactly zero. Thus, unnecessary items are still taken into consideration to some extent. Since its output sums to one, this invariably means less weight is assigned to the relevant items, potentially harming performance and interpretability BIBREF18. This has motivated a line of research on learning networks with sparse mappings BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21, BIBREF22. We focus on a recently-introduced flexible family of transformations, $\\alpha $-entmax BIBREF23, BIBREF14, defined as:\nwhere $\\triangle ^d \\lbrace \\mathbf {p}\\in \\mathbb {R}^d:\\sum _{i} p_i = 1\\rbrace $ is the probability simplex, and, for $\\alpha \\ge 1$, $\\mathsf {H}^{\\textsc {T}}_\\alpha $ is the Tsallis continuous family of entropies BIBREF24:\nThis family contains the well-known Shannon and Gini entropies, corresponding to the cases $\\alpha =1$ and $\\alpha =2$, respectively.\nEquation DISPLAY_FORM14 involves a convex optimization subproblem. Using the definition of $\\mathsf {H}^{\\textsc {T}}_\\alpha $, the optimality conditions may be used to derive the following form for the solution (Appendix SECREF83):\nwhere $[\\cdot ]_+$ is the positive part (ReLU) function, $\\mathbf {1}$ denotes the vector of all ones, and $\\tau $ – which acts like a threshold – is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the $\\sum _i p_i=1$ constraint.\nBackground ::: Sparse Attention ::: Properties of @!START@$\\alpha $@!END@-entmax.\nThe appeal of $\\alpha $-entmax for attention rests on the following properties. For $\\alpha =1$ (i.e., when $\\mathsf {H}^{\\textsc {T}}_\\alpha $ becomes the Shannon entropy), it exactly recovers the softmax mapping (We provide a short derivation in Appendix SECREF89.). For all $\\alpha >1$ it permits sparse solutions, in stark contrast to softmax. In particular, for $\\alpha =2$, it recovers the sparsemax mapping BIBREF19, which is piecewise linear. In-between, as $\\alpha $ increases, the mapping continuously gets sparser as its curvature changes.\nTo compute the value of $\\alpha $-entmax, one must find the threshold $\\tau $ such that the r.h.s. in Equation DISPLAY_FORM16 sums to one. BIBREF23 propose a general bisection algorithm. BIBREF14 introduce a faster, exact algorithm for $\\alpha =1.5$, and enable using $\\mathop {\\mathsf {\\alpha }\\textnormal {-}\\mathsf {entmax }}$ with fixed $\\alpha $ within a neural network by showing that the $\\alpha $-entmax Jacobian w.r.t. $\\mathbf {z}$ for $\\mathbf {p}^\\star = \\mathop {\\mathsf {\\alpha }\\textnormal {-}\\mathsf {entmax }}(\\mathbf {z})$ is\nOur work furthers the study of $\\alpha $-entmax by providing a derivation of the Jacobian w.r.t. the hyper-parameter $\\alpha $ (Section SECREF3), thereby allowing the shape and sparsity of the mapping to be learned automatically. This is particularly appealing in the context of multi-head attention mechanisms, where we shall show in Section SECREF35 that different heads tend to learn different sparsity behaviors.\nAdaptively Sparse Transformers with @!START@$\\alpha $@!END@-entmax\nWe now propose a novel Transformer architecture wherein we simply replace softmax with $\\alpha $-entmax in the attention heads. Concretely, we replace the row normalization $\\mathbf {\\pi }$ in Equation DISPLAY_FORM7 by\nThis change leads to sparse attention weights, as long as $\\alpha >1$; in particular, $\\alpha =1.5$ is a sensible starting point BIBREF14.\nAdaptively Sparse Transformers with @!START@$\\alpha $@!END@-entmax ::: Different @!START@$\\alpha $@!END@ per head.\nUnlike LSTM-based seq2seq models, where $\\alpha $ can be more easily tuned by grid search, in a Transformer, there are many attention heads in multiple layers. Crucial to the power of such models, the different heads capture different linguistic phenomena, some of them isolating important words, others spreading out attention across phrases BIBREF0. This motivates using different, adaptive $\\alpha $ values for each attention head, such that some heads may learn to be sparser, and others may become closer to softmax. We propose doing so by treating the $\\alpha $ values as neural network parameters, optimized via stochastic gradients along with the other weights.\nAdaptively Sparse Transformers with @!START@$\\alpha $@!END@-entmax ::: Derivatives w.r.t. @!START@$\\alpha $@!END@.\nIn order to optimize $\\alpha $ automatically via gradient methods, we must compute the Jacobian of the entmax output w.r.t. $\\alpha $. Since entmax is defined through an optimization problem, this is non-trivial and cannot be simply handled through automatic differentiation; it falls within the domain of argmin differentiation, an active research topic in optimization BIBREF25, BIBREF26.\nOne of our key contributions is the derivation of a closed-form expression for this Jacobian. The next proposition provides such an expression, enabling entmax layers with adaptive $\\alpha $. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first neural network module that can automatically, continuously vary in shape away from softmax and toward sparse mappings like sparsemax.\nProposition 1 Let $\\mathbf {p}^\\star \\mathop {\\mathsf {\\alpha }\\textnormal {-}\\mathsf {entmax }}(\\mathbf {z})$ be the solution of Equation DISPLAY_FORM14. Denote the distribution $\\tilde{p}_i {(p_i^\\star )^{2 - \\alpha }}{ \\sum _j(p_j^\\star )^{2-\\alpha }}$ and let $h_i -p^\\star _i \\log p^\\star _i$. The $i$th component of the Jacobian $\\mathbf {g} \\frac{\\partial \\mathop {\\mathsf {\\alpha }\\textnormal {-}\\mathsf {entmax }}(\\mathbf {z})}{\\partial \\alpha }$ is\nproof uses implicit function differentiation and is given in Appendix SECREF10.\nProposition UNKREF22 provides the remaining missing piece needed for training adaptively sparse Transformers. In the following section, we evaluate this strategy on neural machine translation, and analyze the behavior of the learned attention heads.\nExperiments\nWe apply our adaptively sparse Transformers on four machine translation tasks. For comparison, a natural baseline is the standard Transformer architecture using the softmax transform in its multi-head attention mechanisms. We consider two other model variants in our experiments that make use of different normalizing transformations:\n1.5-entmax: a Transformer with sparse entmax attention with fixed $\\alpha =1.5$ for all heads. This is a novel model, since 1.5-entmax had only been proposed for RNN-based NMT models BIBREF14, but never in Transformers, where attention modules are not just one single component of the seq2seq model but rather an integral part of all of the model components.\n$\\alpha $-entmax: an adaptive Transformer with sparse entmax attention with a different, learned $\\alpha _{i,j}^t$ for each head.\nThe adaptive model has an additional scalar parameter per attention head per layer for each of the three attention mechanisms (encoder self-attention, context attention, and decoder self-attention), i.e.,\nand we set $\\alpha _{i,j}^t = 1 + \\operatornamewithlimits{\\mathsf {sigmoid}}(a_{i,j}^t) \\in ]1, 2[$. All or some of the $\\alpha $ values can be tied if desired, but we keep them independent for analysis purposes.\nExperiments ::: Datasets.\nOur models were trained on 4 machine translation datasets of different training sizes:\n[itemsep=.5ex,leftmargin=2ex]\nIWSLT 2017 German $\\rightarrow $ English BIBREF27: 200K sentence pairs.\nKFTT Japanese $\\rightarrow $ English BIBREF28: 300K sentence pairs.\nWMT 2016 Romanian $\\rightarrow $ English BIBREF29: 600K sentence pairs.\nWMT 2014 English $\\rightarrow $ German BIBREF30: 4.5M sentence pairs.\nAll of these datasets were preprocessed with byte-pair encoding BIBREF31, using joint segmentations of 32k merge operations.\nExperiments ::: Training.\nWe follow the dimensions of the Transformer-Base model of BIBREF0: The number of layers is $L=6$ and number of heads is $H=8$ in the encoder self-attention, the context attention, and the decoder self-attention. We use a mini-batch size of 8192 tokens and warm up the learning rate linearly until 20k steps, after which it decays according to an inverse square root schedule. All models were trained until convergence of validation accuracy, and evaluation was done at each 10k steps for ro$\\rightarrow $en and en$\\rightarrow $de and at each 5k steps for de$\\rightarrow $en and ja$\\rightarrow $en. The end-to-end computational overhead of our methods, when compared to standard softmax, is relatively small; in training tokens per second, the models using $\\alpha $-entmax and $1.5$-entmax are, respectively, $75\\%$ and $90\\%$ the speed of the softmax model.\nExperiments ::: Results.\nWe report test set tokenized BLEU BIBREF32 results in Table TABREF27. We can see that replacing softmax by entmax does not hurt performance in any of the datasets; indeed, sparse attention Transformers tend to have slightly higher BLEU, but their sparsity leads to a better potential for analysis. In the next section, we make use of this potential by exploring the learned internal mechanics of the self-attention heads.\nAnalysis\nWe conduct an analysis for the higher-resource dataset WMT 2014 English $\\rightarrow $ German of the attention in the sparse adaptive Transformer model ($\\alpha $-entmax) at multiple levels: we analyze high-level statistics as well as individual head behavior. Moreover, we make a qualitative analysis of the interpretability capabilities of our models.\nAnalysis ::: High-Level Statistics ::: What kind of @!START@$\\alpha $@!END@ values are learned?\nFigure FIGREF37 shows the learning trajectories of the $\\alpha $ parameters of a selected subset of heads. We generally observe a tendency for the randomly-initialized $\\alpha $ parameters to decrease initially, suggesting that softmax-like behavior may be preferable while the model is still very uncertain. After around one thousand steps, some heads change direction and become sparser, perhaps as they become more confident and specialized. This shows that the initialization of $\\alpha $ does not predetermine its sparsity level or the role the head will have throughout. In particular, head 8 in the encoder self-attention layer 2 first drops to around $\\alpha =1.3$ before becoming one of the sparsest heads, with $\\alpha \\approx 2$.\nThe overall distribution of $\\alpha $ values at convergence can be seen in Figure FIGREF38. We can observe that the encoder self-attention blocks learn to concentrate the $\\alpha $ values in two modes: a very sparse one around $\\alpha \\rightarrow 2$, and a dense one between softmax and 1.5-entmax . However, the decoder self and context attention only learn to distribute these parameters in a single mode. We show next that this is reflected in the average density of attention weight vectors as well.\nAnalysis ::: High-Level Statistics ::: Attention weight density when translating.\nFor any $\\alpha >1$, it would still be possible for the weight matrices in Equation DISPLAY_FORM9 to learn re-scalings so as to make attention sparser or denser. To visualize the impact of adaptive $\\alpha $ values, we compare the empirical attention weight density (the average number of tokens receiving non-zero attention) within each module, against sparse Transformers with fixed $\\alpha =1.5$.\nFigure FIGREF40 shows that, with fixed $\\alpha =1.5$, heads tend to be sparse and similarly-distributed in all three attention modules. With learned $\\alpha $, there are two notable changes: (i) a prominent mode corresponding to fully dense probabilities, showing that our models learn to combine sparse and dense attention, and (ii) a distinction between the encoder self-attention – whose background distribution tends toward extreme sparsity – and the other two modules, who exhibit more uniform background distributions. This suggests that perhaps entirely sparse Transformers are suboptimal.\nThe fact that the decoder seems to prefer denser attention distributions might be attributed to it being auto-regressive, only having access to past tokens and not the full sentence. We speculate that it might lose too much information if it assigned weights of zero to too many tokens in the self-attention, since there are fewer tokens to attend to in the first place.\nTeasing this down into separate layers, Figure FIGREF41 shows the average (sorted) density of each head for each layer. We observe that $\\alpha $-entmax is able to learn different sparsity patterns at each layer, leading to more variance in individual head behavior, to clearly-identified dense and sparse heads, and overall to different tendencies compared to the fixed case of $\\alpha =1.5$.\nAnalysis ::: High-Level Statistics ::: Head diversity.\nTo measure the overall disagreement between attention heads, as a measure of head diversity, we use the following generalization of the Jensen-Shannon divergence:\nwhere $\\mathbf {p}_j$ is the vector of attention weights assigned by head $j$ to each word in the sequence, and $\\mathsf {H}^\\textsc {S}$ is the Shannon entropy, base-adjusted based on the dimension of $\\mathbf {p}$ such that $JS \\le 1$. We average this measure over the entire validation set. The higher this metric is, the more the heads are taking different roles in the model.\nFigure FIGREF44 shows that both sparse Transformer variants show more diversity than the traditional softmax one. Interestingly, diversity seems to peak in the middle layers of the encoder self-attention and context attention, while this is not the case for the decoder self-attention.\nThe statistics shown in this section can be found for the other language pairs in Appendix SECREF8.\nAnalysis ::: Identifying Head Specializations\nPrevious work pointed out some specific roles played by different heads in the softmax Transformer model BIBREF33, BIBREF5, BIBREF9. Identifying the specialization of a head can be done by observing the type of tokens or sequences that the head often assigns most of its attention weight; this is facilitated by sparsity.\nAnalysis ::: Identifying Head Specializations ::: Positional heads.\nOne particular type of head, as noted by BIBREF9, is the positional head. These heads tend to focus their attention on either the previous or next token in the sequence, thus obtaining representations of the neighborhood of the current time step. In Figure FIGREF47, we show attention plots for such heads, found for each of the studied models. The sparsity of our models allows these heads to be more confident in their representations, by assigning the whole probability distribution to a single token in the sequence. Concretely, we may measure a positional head's confidence as the average attention weight assigned to the previous token. The softmax model has three heads for position $-1$, with median confidence $93.5\\%$. The $1.5$-entmax model also has three heads for this position, with median confidence $94.4\\%$. The adaptive model has four heads, with median confidences $95.9\\%$, the lowest-confidence head being dense with $\\alpha =1.18$, while the highest-confidence head being sparse ($\\alpha =1.91$).\nFor position $+1$, the models each dedicate one head, with confidence around $95\\%$, slightly higher for entmax. The adaptive model sets $\\alpha =1.96$ for this head.\nAnalysis ::: Identifying Head Specializations ::: BPE-merging head.\nDue to the sparsity of our models, we are able to identify other head specializations, easily identifying which heads should be further analysed. In Figure FIGREF51 we show one such head where the $\\alpha $ value is particularly high (in the encoder, layer 1, head 4 depicted in Figure FIGREF37). We found that this head most often looks at the current time step with high confidence, making it a positional head with offset 0. However, this head often spreads weight sparsely over 2-3 neighboring tokens, when the tokens are part of the same BPE cluster or hyphenated words. As this head is in the first layer, it provides a useful service to the higher layers by combining information evenly within some BPE clusters.\nFor each BPE cluster or cluster of hyphenated words, we computed a score between 0 and 1 that corresponds to the maximum attention mass assigned by any token to the rest of the tokens inside the cluster in order to quantify the BPE-merging capabilities of these heads. There are not any attention heads in the softmax model that are able to obtain a score over $80\\%$, while for $1.5$-entmax and $\\alpha $-entmax there are two heads in each ($83.3\\%$ and $85.6\\%$ for $1.5$-entmax and $88.5\\%$ and $89.8\\%$ for $\\alpha $-entmax).\nAnalysis ::: Identifying Head Specializations ::: Interrogation head.\nOn the other hand, in Figure FIGREF52 we show a head for which our adaptively sparse model chose an $\\alpha $ close to 1, making it closer to softmax (also shown in encoder, layer 1, head 3 depicted in Figure FIGREF37). We observe that this head assigns a high probability to question marks at the end of the sentence in time steps where the current token is interrogative, thus making it an interrogation-detecting head. We also observe this type of heads in the other models, which we also depict in Figure FIGREF52. The average attention weight placed on the question mark when the current token is an interrogative word is $98.5\\%$ for softmax, $97.0\\%$ for $1.5$-entmax, and $99.5\\%$ for $\\alpha $-entmax.\nFurthermore, we can examine sentences where some tendentially sparse heads become less so, thus identifying sources of ambiguity where the head is less confident in its prediction. An example is shown in Figure FIGREF55 where sparsity in the same head differs for sentences of similar length.\nRelated Work ::: Sparse attention.\nPrior work has developed sparse attention mechanisms, including applications to NMT BIBREF19, BIBREF12, BIBREF20, BIBREF22, BIBREF34. BIBREF14 introduced the entmax function this work builds upon. In their work, there is a single attention mechanism which is controlled by a fixed $\\alpha $. In contrast, this is the first work to allow such attention mappings to dynamically adapt their curvature and sparsity, by automatically adjusting the continuous $\\alpha $ parameter. We also provide the first results using sparse attention in a Transformer model.\nRelated Work ::: Fixed sparsity patterns.\nRecent research improves the scalability of Transformer-like networks through static, fixed sparsity patterns BIBREF10, BIBREF35. Our adaptively-sparse Transformer can dynamically select a sparsity pattern that finds relevant words regardless of their position (e.g., Figure FIGREF52). Moreover, the two strategies could be combined. In a concurrent line of research, BIBREF11 propose an adaptive attention span for Transformer language models. While their work has each head learn a different contiguous span of context tokens to attend to, our work finds different sparsity patterns in the same span. Interestingly, some of their findings mirror ours – we found that attention heads in the last layers tend to be denser on average when compared to the ones in the first layers, while their work has found that lower layers tend to have a shorter attention span compared to higher layers.\nRelated Work ::: Transformer interpretability.\nThe original Transformer paper BIBREF0 shows attention visualizations, from which some speculation can be made of the roles the several attention heads have. BIBREF7 study the syntactic abilities of the Transformer self-attention, while BIBREF6 extract dependency relations from the attention weights. BIBREF8 find that the self-attentions in BERT BIBREF3 follow a sequence of processes that resembles a classical NLP pipeline. Regarding redundancy of heads, BIBREF9 develop a method that is able to prune heads of the multi-head attention module and make an empirical study of the role that each head has in self-attention (positional, syntactic and rare words). BIBREF36 also aim to reduce head redundancy by adding a regularization term to the loss that maximizes head disagreement and obtain improved results. While not considering Transformer attentions, BIBREF18 show that traditional attention mechanisms do not necessarily improve interpretability since softmax attention is vulnerable to an adversarial attack leading to wildly different model predictions for the same attention weights. Sparse attention may mitigate these issues; however, our work focuses mostly on a more mechanical aspect of interpretation by analyzing head behavior, rather than on explanations for predictions.\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe contribute a novel strategy for adaptively sparse attention, and, in particular, for adaptively sparse Transformers. We present the first empirical analysis of Transformers with sparse attention mappings (i.e., entmax), showing potential in both translation accuracy as well as in model interpretability.\nIn particular, we analyzed how the attention heads in the proposed adaptively sparse Transformer can specialize more and with higher confidence. Our adaptivity strategy relies only on gradient-based optimization, side-stepping costly per-head hyper-parameter searches. Further speed-ups are possible by leveraging more parallelism in the bisection algorithm for computing $\\alpha $-entmax.\nFinally, some of the automatically-learned behaviors of our adaptively sparse Transformers – for instance, the near-deterministic positional heads or the subword joining head – may provide new ideas for designing static variations of the Transformer.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC StG DeepSPIN 758969), and by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia through contracts UID/EEA/50008/2019 and CMUPERI/TIC/0046/2014 (GoLocal).

{"input": "What can word subspace represent?", "context": "Introduction\nText classification has become an indispensable task due to the rapid growth in the number of texts in digital form available online. It aims to classify different texts, also called documents, into a fixed number of predefined categories, helping to organize data, and making easier for users to find the desired information. Over the past three decades, many methods based on machine learning and statistical models have been applied to perform this task, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), support vector machines (SVM), and multinomial naive Bayes (MNB).\nThe first step in utilizing such methods to categorize textual data is to convert the texts into a vector representation. One of the most popular text representation models is the bag-of-words model BIBREF0 , which represents each document in a collection as a vector in a vector space. Each dimension of the vectors represents a term (e.g., a word, a sequence of words), and its value encodes a weight, which can be how many times the term occurs in the document.\nDespite showing positive results in tasks such as language modeling and classification BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , the BOW representation has limitations: first, feature vectors are commonly very high-dimensional, resulting in sparse document representations, which are hard to model due to space and time complexity. Second, BOW does not consider the proximity of words and their position in the text and consequently cannot encode the words semantic meanings.\nTo solve these problems, neural networks have been employed to learn vector representations of words BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . In particular, the word2vec representation BIBREF8 has gained attention. Given a training corpus, word2vec can generate a vector for each word in the corpus that encodes its semantic information. These word vectors are distributed in such a way that words from similar contexts are represented by word vectors with high correlation, while words from different contexts are represented by word vectors with low correlation.\nOne crucial aspect of the word2vec representation is that arithmetic and distance calculation between two word vectors can be performed, giving information about their semantic relationship. However, rather than looking at pairs of word vectors, we are interested in studying the relationship between sets of vectors as a whole and, therefore, it is desirable to have a text representation based on a set of these word vectors.\nTo tackle this problem, we introduce the novel concept of word subspace. It is mathematically defined as a low dimensional linear subspace in a word vector space with high dimensionality. Given that words from texts of the same class belong to the same context, it is possible to model word vectors of each class as word subspaces and efficiently compare them in terms of similarity by using canonical angles between the word subspaces. Through this representation, most of the variability of the class is retained. Consequently, a word subspace can effectively and compactly represent the context of the corresponding text. We achieve this framework through the mutual subspace method (MSM) BIBREF9 .\nThe word subspace of each text class is modeled by applying PCA without data centering to the set of word vectors of the class. When modeling the word subspaces, we assume only one occurrence of each word inside the class.\nHowever, as seen in the BOW approach, the frequency of words inside a text is an informative feature that should be considered. In order to introduce this feature in the word subspace modeling and enhance its performance, we further extend the concept of word subspace to the term-frequency (TF) weighted word subspace.\nIn this extension, we consider a set of weights, which encodes the words frequencies, when performing the PCA. Text classification with TF weighted word subspace can also be performed under the framework of MSM. We show the validity of our modeling through experiments on the Reuters database, an established database for natural language processing tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the word subspace formulation and its extension, comparing our methods' performance to various state-of-art methods.\nThe main contributions of our work are:\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \"Related Work\" , we describe the main works related to text classification. In Section \"Word subspace\" , we present the formulation of our proposed word subspace. In Section \"Conventional text classification methods\" , we explain how text classification with word subspaces is performed under the MSM framework. Then, we present the TF weighted word subspace extension in Section \"TF weighted word subspace\" . Evaluation experiments and their results are described in Section \"Experimental Evaluation\" . Further discussion is then presented in Section \"Discussion\" , and our conclusions are described in Section \"Conclusions and Future Work\" .\nRelated Work\nIn this section, we outline relevant work towards text classification. We start by describing how text data is conventionally represented using the bag-of-words model and then follow to describe the conventional methods utilized in text classification.\nText Representation with bag-of-words\nThe bag-of-words representation comes from the hypothesis that frequencies of words in a document can indicate the relevance of the document to a query BIBREF0 , that is, if documents and a query have similar frequencies for the same words, they might have a similar meaning. This representation is based on the vector space model (VSM), that was developed for the SMART information retrieval system BIBREF10 . In the VSM, the main idea is that documents in a collection can be represented as a vector in a vector space, where vectors close to each other represent semantically similar documents.\nMore formally, a document $d$ can be represented by a vector in $\\mathbb {R}^{n}$ , where each dimension represents a different term. A term can be a single word, constituting the conventional bag-of-words, or combinations of $N$ words, constituting the bag-of-N-grams. If a term occurs in the document, its position in the vector will have a non-zero value, also known as term weight. Two documents in the VSM can be compared to each other by taking the cosine distance between them BIBREF1 .\nThere are several ways to compute the term weights. Among them, we can highlight some: Binary weights, term-frequency (TF) weights, and term-frequency inverse document-frequency (TF-IDF) weights.\nConsider a corpus with documents $D = \\lbrace d_i\\rbrace _{i=1}^{|D|}$ and a vocabulary with all terms in the corpus $V = \\lbrace w_i\\rbrace _{i=1}^{|V|}$ . The term weights can be defined as:\nBinary weight: If a term occurs in the document, its weight is 1. Otherwise, it is zero.\nTerm-frequency weight (TF): The weight of a term $w$ is defined by the number of times it occurs in the document $d$ .\n$$TF(w,d) = n_d^w$$   (Eq. 8)\nInverse document-frequency: The weight of a term $w$ , given the corpus $D$ , is defined as the total number of documents $|D|$ divided by the number of documents that have the term $w$ , $|D^w|$ .\n$$IDF(w | D) = \\frac{|D|}{|D^w|}$$   (Eq. 10)\nTerm-frequency inverse document-frequency (TF-IDF): The weight of a term $w$ is defined by the multiplication of its term-frequency and its inverse document-frequency. When considering only the TF weights, all terms have the same importance among the corpus. By using the IDF weight, words that are more common across all documents in $D$ receive a smaller weight, giving more importance to rare terms in the corpus.\n$$TFIDF(w,d | D)=TF \\times IDF$$   (Eq. 12)\nIn very large corpus, it is common to consider the logarithm of the IDF in order to dampen its effect.\n$$TFIDF(w,d | D)=TF \\times log_{10}(IDF)$$   (Eq. 13)\nConventional text classification methods\nMulti-variate Bernoulli (MVB) and multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) are two generative models based on the naive Bayes assumption. In other words, they assume that all attributes (e.g., the frequency of each word, the presence or absence of a word) of each text are independent of each other given the context of the class BIBREF11 .\nIn the MVB model, a document is represented by a vector generated by a bag-of-words with binary weights. In this case, a document can be considered an event, and the presence or the absence of the words to be the attributes of the event. On the other hand, the MNB model represents each document as a vector generated by a bag-of-words with TF weights. Here, the individual word occurrences are considered as events and the document is a collection of word events.\nBoth these models use the Bayes rule to classify a document. Consider that each document should be classified into one of the classes in $C=\\lbrace c_j\\rbrace _{j=1}^{|C|}$ . The probability of each class given the document is defined as:\n$$P(c_j|d_i) = \\frac{P(d_i|c_j)P(c_j)}{P(d_i)}.$$   (Eq. 16)\nThe prior $P(d_i)$ is the same for all classes, so to determine the class to which $d_i$ belongs to, the following equation can be used:\n$$prediction(d_i) = argmax_{c_j}P(d_i|c_j)P(c_j)$$   (Eq. 17)\nThe prior $P(c_j)$ can be obtained by the following equation:\n$$P(c_j) = \\frac{1+|D_j|}{|C|+|D|},$$   (Eq. 18)\nwhere $|D_j|$ is the number of documents in class $c_j$ .\nAs for the posterior $P(d_i|c_j)$ , different calculations are performed for each model. For MVB, it is defined as:\n$$P(d_i|c_j) = \\prod _{k=1}^{|V|}P(w_k|c_j)^{t_i^k}(1-P(w_k|c_j))^{1-t_i^k},$$   (Eq. 19)\nwhere $w_k$ is the k-th word in the vocabulary $V$ , and $t_i^k$ is the value (0 or 1) of the k-th element of the vector of document $d_i$ .\nFor the MNB, it is defined as:\n$$P(d_i|c_j) = P(|d_i|)|d_i|!\\prod _{k=1}^{|V|}\\frac{P(w_k|c_j)^{n_i^k}}{n_i^k!},$$   (Eq. 20)\nwhere $|d_i|$ is the number of words in document $d_i$ and $n_i^k$ is the k-th element of the vector of document $d_i$ and it represents how many times word $w_k$ occurs in $d_i$ .\nFinally, the posterior $P(w_k|c_j)$ can be obtained by the following equation:\n$$P(w_k|c_j) = \\frac{1+|D_j^k|}{|C|+|D|},$$   (Eq. 21)\nwhere $|D_j^k|$ is the number of documents in class $c_j$ that contain the word $w_k$ .\nIn general, MVB tends to perform better than MNB at small vocabulary sizes whereas MNB is more efficient on large vocabularies.\nDespite being robust tools for text classification, both these models depend directly on the bag-of-words features and do not naturally work with representations such as word2vec.\nLatent semantic analysis (LSA), or latent semantic indexing (LSI), was proposed in BIBREF12 , and it extends the vector space model by using singular value decomposition (SVD) to find a set of underlying latent variables which spans the meaning of texts.\nIt is built from a term-document matrix, in which each row represents a term, and each column represents a document. This matrix can be built by concatenating the vectors of all documents in a corpus, obtained using the bag-of-words model, that is, $ {X} = [ {v}_1, {v}_2, ..., {v}_{|D|}]$ , where ${v}_i$ is the vector representation obtained using the bag-of-words model.\nIn this method, the term-document matrix is decomposed using the singular value decomposition,\n$${X} = {U\\Sigma V}^\\top ,$$   (Eq. 23)\nwhere $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices and correspond to the left singular vectors and right singular vectors of $X$ , respectively. $\\Sigma $ is a diagonal matrix, and it contains the square roots of the eigenvalues of $X^TX$ and $XX^T$ . LSA finds a low-rank approximation of $X$ by selecting only the $k$ largest singular values and its respective singular vectors,\n$${X}_k = {U}_k{\\Sigma }_k {V}_k^{\\top }.$$   (Eq. 24)\nTo compare two documents, we project both of them into this lower dimension space and calculate the cosine distance between them. The projection ${\\hat{d}}$ of document ${d}$ is obtained by the following equation:\n$${\\hat{d}} = {\\Sigma }_k^{-1} {U}_k^\\top {d}.$$   (Eq. 25)\nDespite its extensive application on text classification BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 , this method was initially proposed for document indexing and, therefore, does not encode any class information when modeling the low-rank approximation. To perform classification, 1-nearest neighbor is usually performed, placing a query document into the class of the nearest training document.\nThe support vector machine (SVM) was first presented in BIBREF16 and performs the separation between samples of two different classes by projecting them onto a higher dimensionality space. It was first applied in text classification by BIBREF17 and have since been successfully applied in many tasks related to natural language processing BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 .\nConsider a training data set $D$ , with $n$ samples\n$$D = \\lbrace ({x}_i,c_i)|{x}_i\\in \\mathbb {R}^p, c_i \\in \\lbrace -1,1\\rbrace  \\rbrace _{i=1}^{n},$$   (Eq. 27)\nwhere $c_i$ represents the class to which ${x}_i$ belongs to. Each ${x}_i$ is a $p$ -dimensional vector. The goal is to find the hyperplane that divides the points from $c_i = 1$ from the points from $c_i = -1$ . This hyperplane can be written as a set of points $x$ satisfying:\n$${w} \\cdot {x} - b = 0,$$   (Eq. 28)\nwhere $\\cdot $ denotes the dot product. The vector ${w}$ is perpendicular to the hyperplane. The parameter $\\frac{b}{\\Vert {w}\\Vert }$ determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector ${w}$ .\nWe wish to choose ${w}$ and $b$ , so they maximize the distance between the parallel hyperplanes that are as far apart as possible, while still separating the data.\nIf the training data is linearly separable, we can select two hyperplanes in a way that there are no points between them and then try to maximize the distance. In other words, minimize $\\Vert {w}\\Vert $ subject to $c_i({w}\\cdot {x}_u-b) \\ge 1, i=\\lbrace 1,2,...,n\\rbrace $ . If the training data is not linearly separable, the kernel trick can be applied, where every dot product is replaced by a non-linear kernel function.\nWord subspace\nAll methods mentioned above utilize the BOW features to represent a document. Although this representation is simple and powerful, its main problem lies on disregarding the word semantics within a document, where the context and meaning could offer many benefits to the model such as identification of synonyms.\nIn our formulation, words are represented as vectors in a real-valued feature vector space $\\mathbb {R}^{p}$ , by using word2vec BIBREF8 . Through this representation, it is possible to calculate the distance between two words, where words from similar contexts are represented by vectors close to each other, while words from different contexts are represented as far apart vectors. Also, this representation brings the new concept of arithmetic operations between words, where operations such as addition and subtraction carry meaning (eg., “king”-“man”+“woman”=“queen”) BIBREF20 .\nConsider a set of documents which belong to the same context $D_c = \\lbrace d_i\\rbrace _{i=1}^{|D_c|}$ . Each document $d_i$ is represented by a set of $N_i$ words, $d_i = \\lbrace w_k\\rbrace _{k=1}^{N_i}$ . By considering that all words from documents of the same context belong to the same distribution, a set of words $W_c = \\lbrace w_k\\rbrace _{k=1}^{N_c}$ with the words in the context $c$ is obtained.\nWe then translate these words into word vectors using word2vec, resulting in a set of word vectors $X_c = \\lbrace {x}^k_c\\rbrace _{k=1}^{N_c} \\in \\mathbb {R}^p$ . This set of word vectors is modeled into a word subspace, which is a compact, scalable and meaningful representation of the whole set. Such a word subspace is generated by applying PCA to the set of word vectors.\nFirst, we compute an autocorrelation matrix, ${R}_c$ :\n$${R}_c = \\frac{1}{N_c}\\sum _{i=1}^{N_c}{x}^{i}_c{x}_c^{i^{\\top }}.$$   (Eq. 29)\nThe orthonormal basis vectors of $m_c$ -dimensional subspace ${Y}_c$ are obtained as the eigenvectors with the $m_c$ largest eigenvalues of the matrix ${R}_c$ . We represent a subspace ${Y}_c$ by the matrix ${Y}_c \\in \\mathbb {R}^{p \\times m_c}$ , which has the corresponding orthonormal basis vectors as its column vectors.\nText classification based on word subspace\nWe formulate our problem as a single label classification problem. Given a set of training documents, which we will refer as corpus, $D = \\lbrace d_i\\rbrace _{i=1}^{|D|}$ , with known classes $C = \\lbrace c_j\\rbrace _{j=1}^{|C|}$ , we wish to classify a query document $d_q$ into one of the classes in $C$ .\nText classification based on word subspace can be performed under the framework of mutual subspace method (MSM). This task involves two different stages: A learning stage, where the word subspace for each class is modeled, and a classification stage, where the word subspace for a query is modeled and compared to the word subspaces of the classes.\nIn the learning stage, it is assumed that all documents of the same class belong to the same context, resulting in a set of words $W_c = \\lbrace w_c^k\\rbrace _{k=1}^{N_c}$ . This set assumes that each word appears only once in each class. Each set $\\lbrace W_c\\rbrace _{c=1}^{|C|}$ is then modeled into a word subspace ${Y}_c$ , as explained in Section \"Word subspace\" . As the number of words in each class may vary largely, the dimension $m_c$ of each class word subspace is not set to the same value.\nIn the classification stage, for a query document $d_q$ , it is also assumed that each word occurs only once, generating a subspace ${Y}_q$ .\nTo measure the similarity between a class word subspace ${Y}_c$ and a query word subspace ${Y}_q$ , the canonical angles between the two word subspaces are used BIBREF21 . There are several methods for calculating canonical angles BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 , and BIBREF24 , among which the simplest and most practical is the singular value decomposition (SVD). Consider, for example, two subspaces, one from the training data and another from the query, represented as matrices of bases, ${Y}_{c} = [{\\Phi }_{1} \\ldots {\\Phi }_{m_c}] \\in \\mathbb {R}^{p \\times m_c}$ and ${Y}_{q} = [{\\Psi }_{1} \\ldots {\\Psi }_{m_q}] \\in \\mathbb {R}^{p \\times m_q}$ , where ${\\Phi }_{i}$ are the bases for ${Y}_c$ and ${\\Psi }_{i}$ are the bases for ${Y}_q$ . Let the SVD of ${Y}_c^{\\top }{Y}_q \\in \\mathbb {R}^{m_c \\times m_q}$ be ${Y}_c^{\\top }{Y}_q = {U \\Sigma V}^{\\top }$ , where ${Y}_q$0 , ${Y}_q$1 represents the set of singular values. The canonical angles ${Y}_q$2 can be obtained as ${Y}_q$3 ${Y}_q$4 . The similarity between the two subspaces is measured by ${Y}_q$5 angles as follows:\n$$S_{({Y}_c,{Y}_q)}[t] = \\frac{1}{t}\\sum _{i = 1}^{t} \\cos ^{2} \\theta _{i},\\; 1 \\le t \\le m_q, \\; m_q \\le m_c.$$   (Eq. 30)\nFig. 1 shows the modeling and comparison of sets of words by MSM. This method can compare sets of different sizes, and naturally encodes proximity between sets with related words.\nFinally, the class with the highest similarity with $d_q$ is assigned as the class of $d_q$ :\n$$prediction(d_q) = argmax_c(S_{({Y}_c,{Y}_q)}).$$   (Eq. 32)\nTF weighted word subspace\nThe word subspace formulation presented in Section \"Word subspace\" is a practical and compact way to represent sets of word vectors, retaining most of the variability of features. However, as seen in the BOW features, the frequency of words is relevant information that can improve the characterization of a text. To incorporate this information into the word subspace modeling, we propose an extension of the word subspace, called the term-frequency (TF) weighted word subspace.\nLike the word subspace, the TF weighted word subspace is mathematically defined as a low-dimensional linear subspace in a word vector space with high dimensionality. However, a weighted version of the PCA BIBREF25 , BIBREF26 is utilized to incorporate the information given by the frequencies of words (term-frequencies). This TF weighted word subspace is equivalent to the word subspace if we consider all occurrences of the words.\nConsider the set of word vectors $\\lbrace {x}_c^k\\rbrace _{k=1}^{N_c} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{p}$ , which represents each word in the context $c$ , and the set of weights $\\lbrace \\omega _i\\rbrace _{i=1}^{N_c}$ , which represent the frequencies of the words in the context $c$ .\nWe incorporate these frequencies into the subspace calculation by weighting the data matrix ${X}$ as follows:\n$${\\widetilde{X}}={X}{\\Omega }^{1/2},$$   (Eq. 33)\nwhere ${X} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{p \\times N_c}$ is a matrix containing the word vectors $\\lbrace {x}_c^k\\rbrace _{k=1}^{N_c}$ and ${\\Omega }$ is a diagonal matrix containing the weights $\\lbrace \\omega _i\\rbrace _{i=1}^{N_c}$ .\nWe then perform PCA by solving the SVD of the matrix ${\\widetilde{X}}$ :\n$${\\widetilde{X}}={AMB}^{\\top },$$   (Eq. 34)\nwhere the columns of the orthogonal matrices ${A}$ and ${B}$ are, respectively, the left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of the matrix ${\\widetilde{X}}$ , and the diagonal matrix ${M}$ contains singular values of ${\\widetilde{X}}$ .\nFinally, the orthonormal basis vectors of the $m_c$ -dimensional TF weighted subspace ${W}$ are the column vectors in ${A}$ corresponding to the $m_c$ largest singular values in ${M}$ .\nText classification with TF weighted word subspace can also be performed under the framework of MSM. In this paper, we will refer to MSM with TF weighted word subspace as TF-MSM.\nExperimental Evaluation\nIn this section we describe the experiments performed to demonstrate the validity of our proposed method and its extension. We used the Reuters-8 dataset without stop words from BIBREF27 aiming at single-label classification, which is a preprocessed format of the Reuters-21578. Words in the texts were considered as they appeared, without performing stemming or typo correction. This database has eight different classes with the number of samples varying from 51 to over 3000 documents, as can be seen in Table 1 .\nTo obtain the vector representation of words, we used a freely available word2vec model, trained by BIBREF8 , on approximately 100 billion words, which encodes the vector representation in $\\mathbb {R}^{300}$ of over 3 million words from several different languages. Since we decided to focus on English words only, we filtered these vectors to about 800 thousand words, excluding all words with non-roman characters.\nTo show the validity of our word subspace representation for text classification and the proposed extension, we divided our experiment section into two parts: The first one aims to verify if sets of word vectors are suitable for subspace representation, and the second one puts our methods in practice in a text classification test, comparing our results with the conventional methods described in Section \"Related Work\" .\nEvaluation of the word subspace representation\nIn this experiment, we modeled the word vectors from each class in the Reuters-8 database into a word subspace. The primary goal is to visualize how much of the text data can be represented by a lower dimensional subspace.\nSubspace representations are very efficient in compactly represent data that is close to a normal distribution. This characteristic is due to the application of the PCA, that is optimal to find the direction with the highest variation within the data.\nIn PCA, the principal components give the directions of maximum variance, while their corresponding eigenvalues give the variance of the data in each of them. Therefore, by observing the distribution of the eigenvalues computed when performing PCA in the modeling of the subspaces, we can suggest if the data is suitable or not for subspace representation.\nFor each class, we normalized the eigenvalues by the largest one of the class. Fig. 2 shows the mean of the eigenvalues and the standard deviation among classes. It is possible to see that the first largest eigenvalues retain larger variance than the smallest ones. In fact, looking at the first 150 largest eigenvalues, we can see that they retain, on average, 86.37% of the data variance. Also, by observing the standard deviation, we can understand that the eigenvalues distribution among classes follows the same pattern, that is, most of the variance is in the first dimensions. This plot indicates that text data represented by vectors generated with word2vec is suitable for subspace representation.\nText classification experiment\nIn this experiment, we performed text classification among the classes in the Reuters-8 database. We compared the classification using the word subspace, and its weighted extension, based on MSM (to which we will refer as MSM and TF-MSM, respectively) with the baselines presented in Section \"Related Work\" : MVB, MNB, LSA, and SVM. Since none of the baseline methods work with vector set classification, we also compared to a simple baseline for comparing sets of vectors, defined as the average of similarities between all vector pair combinations of two given sets. For two matrices ${A}$ and ${B}$ , containing the sets of vectors $\\lbrace  {x}^{i}_a \\rbrace _{i = 1}^{N_A}$ and $\\lbrace  {x}^{i}_b \\rbrace _{i = 1}^{N_B}$ , respectively, where $N_A$ and $N_B$ are the number of main words in each set, the similarity is defined as:\n$$Sim_{(A,B)} = \\frac{1}{N_A N_B}\\sum _{i}^{N_A}\\sum _{j}^{N_B}{{x}_a^i}^{\\top }{x}_b^j.$$   (Eq. 41)\nWe refer to this baseline as similarity average (SA). For this method, we only considered one occurrence of each word in each set.\nDifferent features were used, depending on the method. Classification with SA, MSM, and TF-MSM was performed using word2vec features, to which we refer as w2v. For MVB, due to its nature, only bag-of-words features with binary weights were used (binBOW). For the same reason, we only used bag-of-words features with term-frequency weights (tfBOW) with MNB. Classification with LSA and SVM is usually performed using bag-of-words features and, therefore, we tested with binBOW, tfBOW, and with the term-frequency inverse document-frequency weight, tfidfBOW. We also tested them using word2vec vectors. In this case, we considered each word vector from all documents in each class to be a single sample.\nTo determine the dimensions of the class subspaces and query subspace of MSM and TF-MSM, and the dimension of the approximation performed by LSA, we performed a 10-fold cross validation, wherein each fold, the data were randomly divided into train (60%), validation (20%) and test set (20%).\nThe results can be seen in Table 2 . The simplest baseline, SA with w2v, achieved an accuracy rate of 78.73%. This result is important because it shows the validity of the word2vec representation, performing better than more elaborate methods based on BOW, such as MVB with binBOW.\nLSA with BOW features was almost 10% more accurate than SA, where the best results with binary weights were achieved with an approximation with 130 dimensions, with TF weights were achieved with 50 dimensions, and with TF-IDF weights were achieved with 30 dimensions. SVM with BOW features was about 3% more accurate than LSA, with binary weights leading to a higher accuracy rate.\nIt is interesting to note that despite the reasonably high accuracy rates achieved using LSA and SVM with BOW features, they poorly performed when using w2v features.\nAmong the baselines, the best method was MNB with tfBOW features, with an accuracy of 91.47%, being the only conventional method to outperform MSM. MSM with w2v had an accuracy rate of 90.62%, with the best results achieved with word subspace dimensions for the training classes ranging from 150 to 181, and for the query ranging from 3 to 217. Incorporating the frequency information in the subspace modeling resulted in higher accuracy, with TF-MSM achieving 92.01%, with dimensions of word subspaces for training classes ranging from 150 to 172, and for the query, ranging from 2 to 109. To confirm that TF-MSM is significantly more accurate than MNB, we performed a t-test to compare their results. It resulted in a p-value of 0.031, which shows that at a 95% significance level, TF-MSM has produced better results.\nDiscussion\nGiven the observation of the eigenvalues distribution of word vectors, we could see that word vectors that belong to the same context, i.e., same class, are suitable for subspace representation. Our analysis showed that half of the word vector space dimensions suffice to represent most of the variability of the data in each class of the Reuters-8 database.\nThe results from the text classification experiment showed that subspace-based methods performed better than the text classification methods discussed in this work. Ultimately, our proposed TF weighted word subspace with MSM surpassed all the other methods. word2vec features are reliable tools to represent the semantic meaning of the words and when treated as sets of word vectors, they are capable of representing the content of texts. However, despite the fact that word vectors can be treated separately, conventional methods such as SVM and LSA may not be suitable for text classification using word vectors.\nAmong the conventional methods, LSA and SVM achieved about 86% and 89%, respectively, when using bag-of-words features. Interestingly, both methods had better performance when using binary weights. For LSA, we can see that despite the slight differences in the performance, tfidfBOW required approximations with smaller dimensions. SVM had the lowest accuracy rate when using the tfidfBOW features. One possible explanation for this is that TF-IDF weights are useful when rare words and very frequent words exist in the corpus, giving higher weights for rare words and lower weights for common words. Since we removed the stop words, the most frequent words among the training documents were not considered and, therefore, using TF-IDF weights did not improve the results.\nOnly MNB with tfBOW performed better than MSM. This result may be because tfBOW features encode the word frequencies, while MSM only considers a single occurrence of words. When incorporating the word frequencies with our TF weighted word subspace, we achieved a higher accuracy of 92.01%, performing better than MNB at a significance level of 95%.\nConclusions and Future Work\nIn this paper, we proposed a new method for text classification, based on the novel concept of word subspace under the MSM framework. We also proposed the term-frequency weighted word subspace which can incorporate the frequency of words directly in the modeling of the subspace by using a weighted version of PCA.\nMost of the conventional text classification methods are based on the bag-of-words features, which are very simple to compute and had been proved to produce positive results. However, bag-of-words are commonly high dimensional models, with a sparse representation, which is computationally heavy to model. Also, bag-of-words fail to convey the semantic meaning of words inside a text. Due to these problems, neural networks started to be applied to generate a vector representation of words. Despite the fact that these representations can encode the semantic meaning of words, conventional methods do not work well when considering word vectors separately.\nIn our work, we focused on the word2vec representation, which can embed the semantic structure of words, rendering vector angles as a useful metric to show meaningful similarities between words. Our experiments showed that our word subspace modeling along with the MSM outperforms most of the conventional methods. Ultimately, our TF weighted subspace formulation resulted in significantly higher accuracy when compared to all conventional text classification methods discussed in this work. It is important to note that our method does not consider the order of the words in a text, resulting in a loss of context information. As a future work, we wish to extend our word subspace concept further in mainly two directions. First, we seek to encode word order, which may enrich the representation of context information. Second, we wish to model dynamic context change, enabling analysis of large documents, by having a long-short memory to interpret information using cues from different parts of a text.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16H02842 and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) scholarship.", "answers": ["Word vectors, usually in the context of others within the same class"], "length": 5151, "dataset": "qasper", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "26eccf323630722b689e91abd27fbbae0da4097e74865c33"}
